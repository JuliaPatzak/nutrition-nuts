    "summary": "This is an American rendition of a British classic. Serve with your choice of savory or sweet toppings, like fruit spread and butter, double Devonshire cream, clotted cream, etc... I love using crumpets as a base for eggs Benedict. If you have an Instant Pot\u00ae you can use the yogurt setting and proof the dough much faster!",
