    "summary": "The original recipe was a non-vegan version I found at another food website. I've made some major overhauls to the original recipe, I feel that I can call it my own. I took the dish to a recent vegan potluck dinner and it was a huge hit!  Lots of flavor. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
