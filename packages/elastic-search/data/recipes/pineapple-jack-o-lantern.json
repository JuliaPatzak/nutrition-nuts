    "summary": "This technique uses one of my newest kitchen gadgets: a pineapple corer-slicer! While you can certainly remove the insides of the pineapple using a knife and spoon, this tool makes the job so incredibly easy! Serve the perfectly sliced pineapple after a delicious meal, and use the juice and bottom scraps in a smoothie!",

        "1 large pineapple",

    ],
    "directions": [
        "Lay the pineapple down horizontally on a cutting board",
        "Using a serrated knife, cut off the top 1 1/2 inches, leaving the leafy crown intact",
        "Set top aside",
        "Place the pineapple upright, with the flesh exposed on the top",
        "Center the pineapple corer-slicer directly over the center core and push down slightly",
        "Hold the pineapple with your left hand while twisting the handle of the corer-slicer clockwise with your right hand, with a slight downward pressure",
        "Continue until you reach the bottom, making sure that you do not cut through the skin at the bottom of the pineapple",
        "Pull up on the handle of the corer-slicer while pulling down with your left hand to remove it from the pineapple",
        "Remove the handle from the corer-slicer and remove the sliced pineapple to a serving plate",
        "Pour any juice that has collected in the bottom of the pineapple into a glass or container for another use",
        "Using a paper towel to get a firm grip, reach into the pineapple and wrap the paper towel around the core that remains inside",
        "Place a firm grip on the core, and twist slightly to detach the core from the bottom of the pineapple",
        "Discard core",
        "Using a large spoon, scrape any remaining pineapple from the bottom of the pineapple to create a level surface for the candle",
        "Using a small flexible paring knife, carve out eyes, nose and a scary grin",
        "Replace the top of the pineapple and refrigerate until ready to display",
        "When ready to display, place a tea light candle inside and illuminate"
