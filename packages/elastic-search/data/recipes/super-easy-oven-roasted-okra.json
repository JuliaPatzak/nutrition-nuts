    "summary": "This is a really easy recipe using frozen okra. Being a full-time employee and a mom of a toddler, I always look for easy and healthy recipes. This one has an Indian flavor to it. It's so easy to put together, and it turns out very well.  When you roast the okra, you'll notice the slime goes away. That's what I really like about this recipe. You don't have to monitor it. Just put it in the oven, and it's done.",
