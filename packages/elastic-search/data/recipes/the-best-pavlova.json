        "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)",
        "Line a sheet pan with parchment paper",

        "An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil",
        "In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form",
        "Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip",
        "Make sure sugar is completely dissolved",
        "Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with lemon juice",
        "Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately 1/4 inch thick",
        "With remainder of mixture, pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape",
        "Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 1 hour",
        "Turn off oven, but leave meringue in oven for an additional 30 minutes",
        "When cool, the meringue should be hard on the outside, and slightly moist on the inside",
        "In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened",
        "Decorate with fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent"
