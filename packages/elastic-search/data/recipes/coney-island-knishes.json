    "summary": "One of my earliest 'exotic' food experiences was eating potato knishes with my Dad in Coney Island. I mean, mashed potatoes in a warm, flaky pastry? This potato fiend will have two, please. Back then their secret was the copious amounts of chicken fat, aka schmaltz, but here I'll show you how succeed without it. Leftover corned beef really shines in these, but anything goes, as long as the base is mashed potato spiked with onions and fried in lots of fat.",
