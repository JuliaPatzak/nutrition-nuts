    "summary": "This recipe is adapted from a recipe from 1988. One of the adaptations is changing it from a large loaf, which can fall apart and can be too large for most dinner parties, to individual muffin tin-sized servings. I've been making this for years and I have requests for it every Shabbat, which is saying a lot for gefilte fish! It's quite critical to have a food processor for this recipe.",
