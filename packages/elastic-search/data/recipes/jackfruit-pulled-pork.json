    "summary": "For vegans and anyone else who wants an interesting and healthy version of pulled pork. It satisfied the craving of this 9-year vegetarian. You may eat this right away by making a sandwich with coleslaw or however you choose, but it is best to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. Then, reheat it. This is especially important if you do not have a slow cooker and choose to cook it in a skillet instead.",
