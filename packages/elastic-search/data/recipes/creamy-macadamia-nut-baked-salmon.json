    "summary": "In my attempt to find a healthy, yet delicious baked salmon recipe that doesn't include all of the butter and mayonnaise that my favorite recipe contains, and that also doesn't consist of the vinegar-sugar combo that many of the recipes listed contain, I came up with this savory, creamy,and nutty recipe that I fell in love with. I hope that you love it as much as I do!",
