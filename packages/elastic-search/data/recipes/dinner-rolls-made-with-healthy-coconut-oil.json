    "summary": "I grew up in my family's restaurant. I revamped this recipe to make it a little healthier. The original recipe was one of my dad's, who was a master chef. People came from all over West Texas to eat 'Stanton's Hot Rolls' and cake doughnuts. I had gained almost 200 pounds and decided to make some changes. At 75 pounds lighter, I'm changing the recipes. Took out the bad cholesterol and added the good. I took out the eggs and cut the salt in half.",
