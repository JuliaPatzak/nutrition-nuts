    "summary": "I needed a nourishing and complete meal-in-one that I could take with me on the go. I prepare this the day before I travel and put it in the fridge overnight. It has a great flavor that, when left to sit at room temperature, bursts through even more. The spinach leaves are sturdy and resilient so don't wilt as would lettuce. I hope you like it.",
