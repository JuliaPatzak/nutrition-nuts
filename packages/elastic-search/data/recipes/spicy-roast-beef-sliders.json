    "summary": "Sloppy, melty goodness. Usually I make these roast beef sliders without the flour to thicken the broth into a gravy, so you can absolutely do it without the flour and just strain the meat before putting on the sliders and then use the sauce like an au jus to dip in on the side, but I preferred these with the meaty gravy. Reminded me of a grown up Sloppy Joe. Yum!",
