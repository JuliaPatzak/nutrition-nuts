    "summary": "This is a splendid recipe that is extremely tasty!  You don't really cook anything, so it is good for kids to make, but it is better if it can chill for about three and a half hours so the marmalade and syrup can seep into the tortilla so you get a sweeter and gooier product.  This simple recipe is tantalizingly gooey and sweet, so it can be used as a snack, part of a meal, or a dessert!",
