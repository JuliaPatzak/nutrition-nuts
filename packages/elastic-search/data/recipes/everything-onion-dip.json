    "summary": "This onion dip is made with everything onions and is everything you'd ever want in an onion dip. Yellow, red, and green onions join savory shallots, flavorful chives, and the key ingredient, dried onion, which makes it taste like the French onion dip of your childhood. You can serve this dip with anything and everything, but if you have to pick, serve it with some sturdy, top-shelf potato chips for any big game or party. And if you're lucky enough to have leftovers, it makes the best baked potato topping!",
