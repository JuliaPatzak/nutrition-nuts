    "summary": "These delicious cookies have a kick of lemon flavor, and they're made from scratch rather than a box mix like the majority of recipes out there. This recipe was created because I absolutely love lemon-flavored desserts, but have an allergy to artificial colorants and dyes used in food. Following this recipe as written, you can take comfort in knowing you're not feeding your children any artificial colorings.",
