    "summary": "My aunt made this for Christmas Eve one year -- it's fantastic! I tweaked her recipe just a bit to my taste, and cooked this meal for a date night. We have been together ever since! Adjust the garlic and vinegar to your liking. I happen to believe that garlic should be included in every meal,so I tend to add more depending on my mood. Don't be put off by the smell of the vinegar. As it cooks down, it becomes sweet and not as strong. Your nose may tell you otherwise! I serve a Pinot Grigio and rice pilaf with this dish to round out the meal.",
