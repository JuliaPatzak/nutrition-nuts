    "author": "Snuffles",
    "summary": "This is an Stougaard old family favorite. Not the easiest to make, but well worth the trouble. Gooey and sweet. Best eaten fresh from the oven. I usually double the recipe, because if you go to the trouble to make yeast rolls--make lots. Milk can also be warmed in the microwave.",
