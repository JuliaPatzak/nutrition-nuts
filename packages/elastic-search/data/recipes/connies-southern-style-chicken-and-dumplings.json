    "summary": "This is my mom's recipe for classic chicken and dumplings.  It is simple, hearty, and delicious!  I often do the chicken in the slow cooker, and do the rest on the stove when I get home from work.  I can have this on the table in 30 minutes using this method.  Also, if you really love dumplings, you might want to double the recipe.",
