    "summary": "Traditional shrimp ceviche is made by 'cooking' raw shrimp in the acid of citrus juice, like lime or grapefruit. In this coastal take on the classic recipe, the shrimp are instead gently cooked in boiling water and cooled before bathing in a creamy marinade of coconut milk. The result: a recipe so easy and refreshing that it will transport you to a breezy beach-side caf\u00e9 after one silky bite.",
