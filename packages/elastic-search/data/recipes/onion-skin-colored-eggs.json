    "summary": "For a beautiful marble effect on hard-boiled eggs at Easter time, wrap the uncooked egg in onion skins before boiling them. These eggs will not stain clothes or hands and they are perfect for an egg hunt because the dew from the grass will not change the colors and because they blend so well with rocks and leaves, they are a bit of a challenge for the older kids.  The yellow and red onions produce a stronger color than the white skins and some will be so beautiful that they are the only centerpiece you will need and you will wish you can keep it forever.",
