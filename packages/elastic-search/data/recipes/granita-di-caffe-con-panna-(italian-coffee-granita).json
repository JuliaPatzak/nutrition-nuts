    "summary": "You are sure to see people enjoying coffee granita if you visit Sicily during the summer months. Here's the recipe so you can make it at home. It's very easy to do but requires a lot of freezing so best to prepare in advance. It's usually served with whipped cream both at the bottom and on top of the glass, alongside a sweet brioche roll. You can store in the freezer for a few days, just make sure to stir well before serving.",
