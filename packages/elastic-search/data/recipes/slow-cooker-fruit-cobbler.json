    "summary": "This easy dessert is always a hit in my house. It is especially good for entertaining; your guests think you slaved away baking when all you did was throw a few simple ingredients into the slow cooker! My favorite fruit mixture is peach/berry but any fruit your family loves will work. Serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",
