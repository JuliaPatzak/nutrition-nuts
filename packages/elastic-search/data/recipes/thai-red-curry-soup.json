    "summary": "Our take on Thai red curry soup calls for jasmine rice instead of rice noodles. We puree the soup before adding onions and herbs for a smooth, rich texture. Adding a squeeze of lemon juice at the end brightens up this traditionally-flavored soup. Serve this as a light dinner entree, or pair it with another protein or vegetable side for a heartier meal.",
