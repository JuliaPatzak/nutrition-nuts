    "summary": "I grew up in Kansas City, where my parent's would go to Shoney's once a week. They had an all-you-can-eat soup and salad bar and it was the highlight of my week. Even as a kid, I've always loved soup. Then we moved out of state. Even though it has been nearly 40 years since I last had it, I never forgot about their beef and cabbage soup. I decided to recreate it based off my memory and here is what I came up with. Enjoy!",
