    "summary": "My grandma made this every weekend to go with her traditional big Irish breakfast.  It's cooked on an electric griddle and cut into toast-sized slices that can be eaten buttered, toasted, or fried crisp in the bacon drippings. Serve with butter and jam or fry insides down on hot pan with bacon drippings for a minute until golden and crispy.  Unfried pieces can be toasted on the second day, but won't keep longer then that.",
