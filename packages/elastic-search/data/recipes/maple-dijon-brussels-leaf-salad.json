    "summary": "This is my go-to unexpected side for Thanksgiving and other pot-lucks. Aside from being gorgeous, it holds up well when made ahead, tastes great at room temp, and appeals to lots of eaters because it's vegan, paleo, gluten-free, and low-carb friendly. The only thing that takes time is deconstructing the Brussels sprouts. The salad keeps in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",
