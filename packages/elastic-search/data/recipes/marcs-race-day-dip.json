    "summary": "This is an easy hot dip that I love to serve at NASCAR parties.  Can use for any occasion and can use many different types of meats, or omit the meat entirely. Sometimes I add 3/4 pound of cooked ground turkey or lean ground beef if I want to make it more of a meal.  Add extra peppers or spices if you like your food hotter.  I usually make 2 pans, one with lots of hot stuff and one omitting the chiles, olives and peppers.",
