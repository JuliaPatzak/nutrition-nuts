    "summary": "I wanted something unique and fun for my grandson's birthday. I initially thought about doing a rainbow layer cake, but thought I might be able to achieve an actual rainbow arc if I used a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt\u00ae). I was thrilled when we sliced this and I saw how vibrant and arc-shaped the rainbow turned out. And my little guy was delighted with it ... he thought I was magic!",
