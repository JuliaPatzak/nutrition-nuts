    "summary": "This is the most adorable and unique snack for your child to take to school on their birthday or for a special treat day.  You will be the star mommy for coming in with a tray of these bite-size burgers! The vanilla wafers are the exact shape and color of a hamburger bun and the brownie looks just like a grilled hamburger when sandwiched between the vanilla wafers. We love 'ketchup' on our brownie hamburgers; but you could use yellow icing for 'mustard' or green icing for 'relish'.",
