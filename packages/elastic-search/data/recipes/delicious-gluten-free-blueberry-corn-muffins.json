    "summary": "After I was diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity, I played around with various recipes so that I could not only eat food that worked with my system, but also enjoy it. I love this blueberry muffin almost as much as the original, all-purpose flour version, and the rest of my family can enjoy it too without feeling like it's a sacrifice. I generally use brown rice flour, but white rice flour may yield a fluffier muffin. I personally like the texture the cornmeal adds, but for a more traditional muffin, feel free to do all rice flour (maybe half brown, half white).",
