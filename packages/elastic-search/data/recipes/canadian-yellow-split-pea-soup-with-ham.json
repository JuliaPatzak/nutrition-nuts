    "summary": "Creamy yellow pea soup studded with bits of ham, carrots, celery, and thyme. There is nothing like this one on a cold day! I am a Canadian now living in the US. and cannot get Habitant\u00ae soup anymore, so I came up with this version. I think it is as good as the real thing, if not better, because it is homemade.",
