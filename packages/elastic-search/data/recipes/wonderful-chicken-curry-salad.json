    "summary": "I created this salad for a party last year.  It tastes wonderful, and everyone asks for the recipe. Serve on croissants or lettuce leaves. For a fancy presentation, line a platter with red leaf lettuce, and top with cream puff shells that have been stuffed with salad (small shells for appetizers or large shell for main dish).",
