    "summary": "At lease once a week my family enjoys these subs. Shaved steak, sharp American cheese, fresh mushrooms on soft toasted scala sub rolls, and I serve them with steak fries with chicken gravy and bread n' butter pickles...and an ice cold beer for the adults. Add ketchup or any veggies like green leafy lettuce, fresh tomatoes, mayo, or blue cheese dressing. We like ours with a squirt of ketchup on the side for dipping. Enjoy!",
