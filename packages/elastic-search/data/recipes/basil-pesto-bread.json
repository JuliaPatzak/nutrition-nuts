    "summary": "At a recent party our friends went wild over this. A simple pesto is spread on Italian bread and layered with roma tomatoes and cheese. It takes a little time, but it is worth it.  I freeze the basil in ice cube trays, then put the cubes in freezer bags. You can easily take out and thaw what you need. Enjoy!",
