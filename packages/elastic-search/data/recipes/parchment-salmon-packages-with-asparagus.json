        "Cut two 12 to 14-inch squares from a roll of parchment paper",
        "Fold each piece in half along the longer side and cut a half-heart shape away from the fold, just like you did in elementary school to make valentines",

        "Place the salmon, skin-side down, on top of the asparagus spears",
