    "summary": "We had some beautiful tilapia fillets, but no recipes! I had recently bought some amazing sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, and decided to invent a slightly Mediterranean fish dish for a quick weeknight dinner.  My husband is a recipe purist, always follows them to the letter, but after this, he's learned to trust my inventions!",
