    "summary": "This is one of my many Japanese-style salad dressings I created to satisfy my taste.  Ume(boshi) is a favored taste addition in many Japanese cooking.  It shows up in cakes, cookies, snacks, mochi, salads, beverages, soups, with pork, chicken and fish, and of course dressing.  You can find umeboshi in Japanese markets in refrigerated section.  Ume is often called plum or pickled plums, however it is much closer to apricots.  You can find ume trees in US now.  Ume is not tasty fresh and must be either pickled or preserved.",
