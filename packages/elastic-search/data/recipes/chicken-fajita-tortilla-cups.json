    "summary": "If you like to impress when you cook, these are the appetizers for you. Perfect finger food for a small gathering, a work potluck or my favorite, a Cinco de Mayo party. These require a little bit of work to prepare, but are fun, festive and worth it. Garnish with sour cream if desired. I have served just as an appetizer with chips and salsa or along with my sour cream chicken enchiladas. Good with beer and/or margaritas.",
