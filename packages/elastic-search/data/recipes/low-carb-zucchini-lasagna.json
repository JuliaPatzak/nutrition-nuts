        "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat",
        "Cook and stir ground beef and Italian sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes",
        "Add onion and saute until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes",
        "Add pasta sauce and chicken broth",
        "Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes",
