    "summary": "This is a wonderful chili recipe that I have used to win chili cook-offs in Indiana. It's hearty and spicy award winning chili that is sure to hit the spot on a cold winter's night. The key is in using name brand tomato soup, I have tried it with others but haven't gotten the same results. Your friends will never guess the secret ingredient. Enjoy!",
