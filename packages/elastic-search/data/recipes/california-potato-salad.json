    "summary": "Since my partner is very picky about what he likes in his potato salad, I have made my own version of home-made PS and it's always a hit with friends and family. Not for the calorie faint but it's real, real good! Ingredient quantities are variable to taste. I think it's the garlic that takes it to the next level. Try it! For best flavor allow it to set overnight in the fridge. Using a mix of yellow, white, and red potatoes is really the best.",
