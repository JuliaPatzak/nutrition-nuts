    "summary": "I made this delicious and rustic torta di riso with fresh spinach and leeks, but the recipe is a perfect catch-all for those abundant summer vegetables. Things like eggplant, peppers, beans, and squash all work beautifully. Just cut them kind of small, cook them tender, and let the rice, cheese, and eggs do the rest.",
