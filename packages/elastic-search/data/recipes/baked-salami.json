    "summary": "I found this recipe years ago.  My first thought was that it was strange, but decided to keep it anyway.  I have made this many times since and it is one of the first appetizers to go!  It is simple enough for football parties or nice enough for cocktail parties.  Be careful when you slice the salami so that all the slices are on the same side.  The salami has a tendency to twist! Serve with crackers.",
