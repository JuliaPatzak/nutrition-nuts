    "summary": "My first taste of a truly delicious scone was in a tiny cafe in Totnes, England. That day I savored Devon cream tea, which is a pot of English tea, warm scones, clotted cream, and freshly-made strawberry jam. I was hooked! I hope you enjoy these sweet and savory scones as much as we do.",
