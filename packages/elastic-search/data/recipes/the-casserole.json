    "summary": "My mom invented this flexible casserole when my first child was born -- and it's been a standard in our household ever since! The soups and veggies may be easily varied. I tend to used boxed mashed potatoes, and they're great, too. To double the recipe (and freeze one), only use 3 total cans of soup -- it gets really juicy.  Yum!",
