    "summary": "I've tried a couple of butterbeer recipes I found online, and they all were either so sweet they made me sick or they had oily butter in them that made me sick. I opted for a simplified version that tasted a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch and was strong enough to slightly inebriate something larger than a house elf. Great for Harry Potter-themed parties or Halloween. Served super-chilled in a frosted mug, it can magically warm up even the coldest wizards.",
