    "summary": "An authentic Greek salad from Oia, Santorini in Greece. Traveling through Greece, I feel in love with the Greek salads on the islands because they had no lettuce.  When I came home, I was determined to replicate that salad for family and friends.   This is a great green salad recipe because extra salad can marinate in the dressing overnight and be eaten the next day in pita pockets as a sandwich.",
