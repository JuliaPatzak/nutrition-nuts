    "summary": "This is a lovely cheese sauce on toast.  It was my mom's recipe.  She used to make this when she had to feed a family of 9 with very few resources.  However, I remember this as some of the best comfort food. Serve over buttered toast.  For an extra special dish, we like to top it with a fried egg.",
