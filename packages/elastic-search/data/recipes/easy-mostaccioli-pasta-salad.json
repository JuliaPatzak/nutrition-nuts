    "summary": "I discovered this tasty mostaccioli pasta salad in a church cookbook over 15 years ago, then the dog ate the cookbook! The recipe was lost for over a decade until it was recovered through the miracle of crowdsourcing. I'm excited to share it with everyone so this won't happen again! Enjoy! Best when made the day before serving.",
