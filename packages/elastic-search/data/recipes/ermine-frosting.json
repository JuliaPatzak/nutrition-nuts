    "summary": "Light and creamy ermine frosting to compliment any cake. I use this instead of a cream cheese frosting on red velvet cake or cupcakes. The almond flavoring really compliments red velvet and offers an alternative if you're not fond of cream cheese frosting. It makes enough to frost 18+ cupcakes or a 3-layer cake.",
