    "summary": "Chicken Kiev is not a last-minute thing but one that takes planning and is well worth the effort. It's crispy on the outside while the butter mixture flavors the chicken throughout but still leaves that pop of butter when you cut it open. Traditionally it is deep-fried first prior to being baked, but this recipe eliminates that step and cooks it from start to finish in the air fryer, making it a healthier and quicker alternative.",
