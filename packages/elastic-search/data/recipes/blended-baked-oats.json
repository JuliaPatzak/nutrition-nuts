    "summary": "Who says eating your morning oatmeal has to be boring? Try these blended baked oats made with banana, egg, and almond milk. A really ripe banana adds sweetness. It reminds me of a muffin. The flavor possibilities are endless, but I've included my favorites in the footnotes. You can leave out the egg, but it won't be as fluffy.",
