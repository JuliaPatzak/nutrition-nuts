    "summary": "This is my brother Bob's recipe.  I've always been loathe to eat food made with Bambi, but I couldn't resist the smell of this.  Know what?  It was delicious!  He brings this out at football watching parties, but denies it's venison until after the taste test. Serve with rice or noodles.",
