    "summary": "Not a pudding, but a puffed pastry baked with meat drippings. We in the U.S. tend to think Yorkshire pudding and popovers are the same thing.  Popovers are hard and very airy.  Yorkshire pudding is softer and doesn't rise as high as a popover. Traditionally served with roast beef.",
