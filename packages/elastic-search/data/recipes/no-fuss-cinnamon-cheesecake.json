    "summary": "When my friend Dee gave me this recipe I was very skeptical.  Who ever heard of cheesecake made with crescent dough?  I made it one day when I had 3 back-up desserts and it was one of the first to go. So easy to make and a popular demand by my family, I make it all the time.  Hey!!  Even my no-impress mother-in-law asked for the recipe!!!  Enjoy!",
