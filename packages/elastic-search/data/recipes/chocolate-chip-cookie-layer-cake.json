    "summary": "I first made this cake for my brother's birthday. He doesn't care for normal cake, and his favorite sweet is chocolate chip cookies, so he (and all the rest of the family) loved this. He has asked for it every birthday since. One time when I served it to ten people and there was leftovers, I caught my dad eating it for breakfast the next morning! All lovers of chocolate chip cookies must try it! Serve with vanilla ice cream.",
