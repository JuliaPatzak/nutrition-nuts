    "summary": "A slightly different recipe using a combination of ingredients, this meatloaf tastes absolutely divine! Instead of the usual ketchup, tomato paste, and brown sugar, this meatloaf is more of an 'upscale' version of the traditional. Best served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This is my own personal creation! I substitute ground deer meat occasionally instead of beef, only because I have a freezer full, and it's organic!",
