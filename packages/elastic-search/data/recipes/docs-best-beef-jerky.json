    "summary": "I have been making jerky for years. This is my recipe concocted by trial and error. Everyone who has tried it says it is the 'best jerky' they have ever had! My dehydrator is designed for jerky. It takes me about 4 hours to dry the meat. This could also be done in the oven or using other dehydrators. Please check your manual for correct times as each machine is different. I hope you enjoy this jerky as much as me and my family do.",
