    "summary": "Styled after a similar appetizer at The Blue Moose in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, this is a very addicting creamy appetizer that goes well with tortilla chips. It has a little kick, but not enough to make your eyes water. Of course, for the heat lovers, you can kick it up a notch if desired. This has become an instant family-favorite and one of my most requested appetizers.",
