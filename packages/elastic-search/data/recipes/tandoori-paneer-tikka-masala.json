    "summary": "Paneer tikka masala is a favorite dish both in North and South India although the dish itself may have originated in North India. Traditionally, paneer is roasted in a tandoor or a clay oven, but here you use your oven. The aroma of spices and paneer cooking in the oven is mouthwatering and makes one feel hungry right away. This recipe replicates the taste of paneer tikka masala served in restaurants while eliminating cream and milk that is typically used.",
