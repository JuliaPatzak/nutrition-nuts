    "summary": "It always feels a little wrong making a frittata with freshly cooked vegetables, since the whole point of the dish is to use up leftovers, but seeing as we're making this for a Mother's Day brunch special, we'll make an exception. Make sure all your vegetables are tender, hot, and well seasoned before adding your eggs, and not a lot can go wrong.",
