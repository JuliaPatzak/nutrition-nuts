        "6 cups shelled walnut halves",
        "\u00bd cup white sugar, or as needed",
        "1 cup canola oil",
        "1 pinch salt to taste"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Bring a pot of water to a boil, and stir in half the walnuts; reduce heat to medium, and boil for 1 minute",
        "Remove nuts with a slotted spoon, and let drain in a colander set in the sink",
        "Repeat with remaining walnuts",
        "Rinse the walnuts under hot water, and transfer to a mixing bowl",
        "Toss the walnuts with the sugar",
        "In an electric skillet with heat set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), heat the canola oil",
        "With a metal slotted spoon, place enough nuts to cover the bottom of the skillet; the oil will sizzle and pop, so be careful to avoid spatters",
        "Gently stir the nuts with the spoon",
        "Fry the walnuts until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch",
        "Transfer the walnuts in clumps to a baking sheet",
