    "summary": "Better than Olive Garden\u00ae! Top with grilled chicken on fettuccine pasta for a complete meal or use as a dip for bread sticks. Delicious rich and creamy spinach Alfredo everyone will love. When I make this dish, everyone raves over it! Add more spinach if you're a spinach lover or leave it out if you're not a fan. I like adding lots of garlic! For a thicker sauce, add more cream cheese.",
