    "summary": "There's no excuse not to whip up a crusty loaf of Irish soda bread this St. Patrick's Day, especially when it's part-whole wheat and packed with oats! One of the best quick breads out there, soda bread is so easy that the hardest part is waiting for it to cool before serving it with salted Irish butter. I've also included a few variations you can try out!",
