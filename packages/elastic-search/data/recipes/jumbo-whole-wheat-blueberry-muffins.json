    "summary": "I received free blueberries recently. I admit I never actually tasted a real one before. Always the boxed muffin kind. I loved them. Recently switched to whole wheat, so I wanted to try a new muffin recipe out. This is the one that not only turned out great, but filling as well. When I was eating it, I was craving eggs. Next time I will have to remember to throw in a fried egg or two on the side. I made 6 jumbo muffins.",
