    "summary": "Enjoy a great tasting dish to share with family and friends. Special dish for vegetarians, and one of our favorite meals. Instead of placing the onion on top you can mix it along with the lentils and rice before serving. It makes a perfect meal with a fresh green salad. Also you can use 2 cups of vegetable broth instead of 2 cups of water to cook the lentils.",
