    "summary": "This simple pot roast makes its own gravy in the slow cooker. As a single parent to girls, I am always trying to get the food groups into my abbreviated meals. I threw in potatoes, carrots, yellow squash, and zucchini to add to the original base recipe. They love stew, so this leads them in that direction, but is still a roast. It was a hit. I hope you enjoy it!",
