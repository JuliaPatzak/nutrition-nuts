    "summary": "A cashew-based queso dip that has tons of flavor and would fool even the pickiest of queso aficionados! This recipe is best made in a high powered blender (I have a Vitamix\u00ae). I cannot say what it would be like in something different! Enjoy with tortilla chips or homemade salsa.",
