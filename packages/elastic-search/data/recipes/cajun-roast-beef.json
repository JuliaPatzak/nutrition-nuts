    "summary": "Not being from the Gulf Coast but living here now, I love the Cajun Roast Beef you can get in the delis right alongside the regular. Distinctively garlicky, I wanted to try roasting it in my own kitchen but found few recipes. Here's my version. It's not spicy, but it has the garlic and thyme that meld to make the savory, regional flavor. We like to serve the beef on toasted rolls with garlic mayonnaise.",
