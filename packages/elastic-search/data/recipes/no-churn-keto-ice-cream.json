    "summary": "Quick to make and no ice cream machine needed! After trying different variations of ingredients, I finally figured out a combination that produced a smooth and creamy texture, yet didn't freeze rock-hard like most no-churn ice cream can. The vodka is optional, however it really helps keep the ice cream scoopable and you don't taste it!",
