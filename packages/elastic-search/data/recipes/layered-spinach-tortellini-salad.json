    "summary": "Not your standard 7-layer salad, this is always a big hit at pitch-ins and my wonderful daughter even requests it for her birthday dinner and other family functions. It has that 'just right' side dish flavor and lightness, while still being a special treat. If you use real bacon bits and bottled dressing, it's even faster to have ready for drop-in guests! Add croutons or fresh Parmesan cheese to top if desired. Store in refrigerator and serve chilled.",
