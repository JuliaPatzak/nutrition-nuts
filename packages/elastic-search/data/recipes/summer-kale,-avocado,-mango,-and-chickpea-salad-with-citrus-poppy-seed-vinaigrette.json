    "summary": "This is a delicious summer salad. Great as a dinner salad with some grilled chicken or fish, or as a side. This is my first experience with kale, and I'm hooked! Add nuts (walnuts, cashews, slivered almonds), sunflower seeds, or dried fruit (cranberries or cherries) for some added texture and deliciousness! I also like to add thinly sliced red bell peppers or Shepherd peppers; it is a salad, anything goes! The citrus vinaigrette is light and refreshing. Sometimes I want a sweeter vinaigrette, hence the addition of marmalade. Apricot would work well, too. A great summertime salad.",
