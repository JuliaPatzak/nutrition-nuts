    "summary": "This is the ultimate spinach dip! It is made from fresh spinach leaves and spring onions. I'm always asked to bring this along to major family events and, of course, during the holidays. It may be served at once, but tastes best when chilled for an hour. Serve with slices of sourdough baguettes.",
