    "summary": "I'm very excited about this mini chocolate cupcake recipe. It saves time, money, and most of all, butter! I love using butter for cupcakes but it's pricey and you may notice your cupcake is a little dense if it's sitting out for a while. This recipe contains extra-virgin olive oil and no coffee. Use good quality cocoa powder because I do notice a difference when using generic. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do! Happy baking!",
