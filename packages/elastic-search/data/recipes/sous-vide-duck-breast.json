    ],
    "directions": [
        "Cut several very shallow crosswise slashes across the skin of each duck breast about 1/2 inch apart",

        "Fill a large Dutch oven about 2/3 full with water",
        "Bring water to 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) over medium heat",
        "Attach a candy or oil thermometer to the side of the Dutch oven in order to monitor and maintain the water temperature",
        "Place a silicone hot pad into bottom of the pan to keep the plastic bag from contacting the hot bottom of the pan",
        "Place plastic bag containing duck breasts in the Dutch oven, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature at 135 degrees F (57 degrees C)",
        "Cook for 1 hour, moving the bag around occasionally and maintaining the temperature",
        "Remove duck breasts from plastic bag and pat dry",
        "Generously season skin sides with salt",
        "Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat",
