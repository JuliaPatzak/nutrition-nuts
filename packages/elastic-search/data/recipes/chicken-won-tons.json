    "summary": "This is an easy way to use up small amounts of leftover chicken, and no one fights over white or dark meat! It can serve as a good appetizer for unexpected guests, snack, junk food meal (we all do it) or tempter for a little picky eater. We fell in love with these at a Mexican restaurant; the flavors can vary depending on your family's taste - Italian, oriental, whatever!",
