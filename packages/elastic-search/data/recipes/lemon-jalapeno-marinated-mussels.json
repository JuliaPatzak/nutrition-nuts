    "summary": "My favorite way to enjoy mussels during hot-weather months? Chilled and marinated! No matter how you dress these mussels, you'll want to follow the same basic technique. By cooking them with a minimum of moisture, and then reducing the liquids for the base of our marinade, we get an even more intense flavor, as well as an extra little kick of salinity. Garnish with a slice or two of red Fresno chile if desired.",
