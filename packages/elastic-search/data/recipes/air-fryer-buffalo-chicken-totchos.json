    "summary": "This appetizer takes minimal prep time thanks to ingredients like rotisserie chicken, salsa, and Tater Tots\u00ae! Make it as mild as you want for the kids, or as mouth-burning as you want for those who wish to have an inferno experience! I swapped from the traditional blue cheese to Cheddar cheese, but feel free to use any cheese you like.",
