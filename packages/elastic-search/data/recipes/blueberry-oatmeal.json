    "summary": "Oatmeal is a great way to start the day and this is a recipe I have developed over the years. It's delicious, light, and great with milk to help cool it down. You can replace the milk with soy milk, if desired. You can add the blueberries earlier in the cooking process if you like them hotter and plumper.",
