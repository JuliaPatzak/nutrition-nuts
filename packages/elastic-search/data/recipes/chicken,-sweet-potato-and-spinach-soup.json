    "summary": "My mom made this for me every time I was sick; it was the only thing I could keep down. It was mild but I love it even when I'm not under the weather. She would use her own roasted chickens, but when I'm not feeling well I don't feel like roasting my own chicken, and the store-bought ones work in a pinch. Serve with crusty bread.",
