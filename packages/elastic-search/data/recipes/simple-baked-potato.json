    "summary": "This recipe for baked potatoes is delicious with steak, meatloaf, or by itself. I never was fan of the potato's skin until I began making this recipe! These potatoes taste amazing loaded with cheese, sour cream, and/or chives! If you want to get fancy, use this recipe as a base recipe for one of the many potato skin, whipped baked potato, or other more-to-it recipes on here.",
