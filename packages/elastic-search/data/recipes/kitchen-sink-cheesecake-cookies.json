    "summary": "The ingredients list may seem unorthodox but trust me, these cookies are delicious. The marshmallows melt, creating a delightfully gooey texture and caramelized melty goodness oozing from the cookies. Perfect to customize to suit kids' (or adults') preferences! This recipe is quite resilient to substitutions and omissions.",
