    "summary": "This is a popular dish made with preserved lemons in all Moroccan homes and is also served at weddings. Each home makes slight changes in the recipe. This one I learned from a cook in my mother-in-law's home. Moroccans eat off a communal plate. This chicken is served on a single plate in the center of the table (at weddings you will see four chickens on one large platter), eaten with crusty bread and no utensils. You, of course, can use your knife and fork!",
