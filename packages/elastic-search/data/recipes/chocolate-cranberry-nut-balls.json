    "summary": "I'm gravitating towards the Paleo Diet so I created this high-protein and energy snack recipe out of a desire to eliminate those expensive and so-called nutritious protein bars. I don't want all of the processed carbs that are hidden in them because, quite honestly, they aren't that healthy. These are really tasty and my whole family loves them. I recommend making them fairly small and bite-sized, as they can crumble a little as you're biting into them. Freezing or refrigerating them keeps the messiness down, but they won't spoil if left at room temperature. I eat 4 or 5 with a big glass of water and feel full!",
