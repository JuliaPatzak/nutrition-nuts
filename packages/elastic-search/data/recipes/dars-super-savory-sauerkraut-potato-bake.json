    "summary": "This dish has some of the flavors that I miss from my childhood in Germany. It is comfort food with a capital 'C.'  I like to pair it with my own pork schnitzel or with baked chicken for a hearty dinner. This dish also includes a recipe for a creamy sauce that I use both in pot pies and as a substitute for condensed soups in many recipes. 'Guten Appetit!'",
