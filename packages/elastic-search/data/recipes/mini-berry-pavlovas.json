    "summary": "Pavlova is a wonderful meringue-based dessert named for the legendary Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova. Pavlova is commonly served with a fruit component, it is fabulous to serve for company and easy to make! For an even fancier presentation, flip a muffin tin upside down, and pipe the meringue with a large star tip around the cups.",
