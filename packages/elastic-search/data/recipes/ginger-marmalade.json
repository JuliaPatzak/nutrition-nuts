    "summary": "This is the best ginger marmalade that I have ever tasted. Recently disappointed with the texture and aftertaste of another ginger marmalade, I searched for a homemade ginger marmalade and found only one very inadequate recipe. I created my own based on an orange marmalade recipe, and it turned out great.",

    "ingredients": [
        "3\u2009\u00bd cups peeled fresh ginger",
        "4 cups water",
        "5 cups white sugar",
        "1 (3 ounce) pouch liquid pectin",
        "5  half pint canning jars with lids and rings"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Divide the ginger in half, and chop half into cubes; shred the other half with a box grater or in a food processor using the shredding blade",
        "Total ginger should equal 3 cups",
        "Place the ginger into a large saucepan with water over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer",
        "Cover the pot, and simmer the ginger until tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes",
        "Add more water if needed to keep mixture from drying out",
        "Pour the cooked ginger into a fine-mesh strainer, drain, and retain 1/2 cup of the ginger-flavored water",
        "Place the cooked ginger in a bowl with the retained liquid, and cool at least 4 hours or overnight in refrigerator",
        "When ginger is thoroughly cooled, place into a large, heavy-bottomed pot, and stir in the sugar; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly",
        "Stir in the pouch of liquid pectin, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for 7 more minutes, skimming foam from top of marmalade",
        "Sterilize the canning jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes",
        "Pack the marmalade into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top",
        "Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles",
        "Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue",
        "Top with lids, and screw on rings",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water",
        "Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder",
        "Leave a 2 inch space between the jars",
        "Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars",
        "Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes",
        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool",
        "Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)",
        "Store in a cool, dark area"
