    "summary": "The idea of rocky road is pretty much that: piles of rocky goodies all coated and glued together with chocolate that doesn't crack when you bite into it (thanks to coconut oil). So although I have used some fairly gourmet ingredients here, don't feel locked into that. Just go with what you have in the cupboard that you think will go well together!",
