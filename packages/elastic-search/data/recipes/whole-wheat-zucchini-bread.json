    "summary": "I took an old favorite and juiced it up by cutting the white sugar completely, replacing with honey and brown sugar to reduce the total sweetener by half.  I also cut the oil back to 25 percent and introduced one-third whole wheat flour.  The results are in; it's even better than the original! I like to use the huge zucchini that didn't get picked on time, as long as it's still green and healthy.  This is a large batch recipe, but you can easily cut it in half.",
