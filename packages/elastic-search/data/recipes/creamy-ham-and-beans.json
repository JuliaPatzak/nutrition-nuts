    "summary": "This soup freezes well and many people who don't like ham and beans like this soup. It serves 20, depending on the appetites of people eating this delicious soup. Note: I usually soak beans overnight and then they will cook faster. Also only mash a few beans to check them for softness, don't mash them all.",
