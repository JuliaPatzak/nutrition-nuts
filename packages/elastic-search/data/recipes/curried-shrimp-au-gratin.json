        "Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes",

        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Grease a 2-quart baking dish",
