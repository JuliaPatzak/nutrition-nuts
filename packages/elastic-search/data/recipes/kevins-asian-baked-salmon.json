    "summary": "Although especially delicious when made with salmon fillets, this savory dish with Asian flavor works well with salmon steaks too. If preferred, use fresh mushrooms caps and cut them into bite-size pieces before adding to the oyster sauce and sherry. Serve this salmon dish with a side of saffron rice and green vegetables.",
