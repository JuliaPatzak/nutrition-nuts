    "summary": "A light dinner of Vidalia onion pie, a nice salad on the side, and a ice cold glass of homemade lemonade is perfect for hot summer nights! Optional additions can be sweet red pepper to the onions as they cook and/or crumbled bacon or fresh ham bits may be added to the mixture prior to baking.  All versions are great! If desired,  a couple Vidalia onion rings look great on the top of the pie for decoration!",
