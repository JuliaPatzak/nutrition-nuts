    "summary": "I love Texas sheet cake! Chocolate, white...it doesn't matter. But they all have so much butter. I tried to lighten up an excellent white Texas sheet cake recipe I found on this site by using applesauce in place of some (but not all!) of the butter. To complement the flavor of apples, I also used chai spices for a little added flavor.",
