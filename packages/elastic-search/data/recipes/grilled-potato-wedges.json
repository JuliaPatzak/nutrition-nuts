    "summary": "We just started cooking with a 30-inch gas grill after decades of using a Weber\u00ae charcoal grill. While we still use the charcoal grill, the extra space allotted to us on the gas grill has made us really branch out with different sides. I created this one knowing we could put the potatoes directly on the grill and not have to make a foil packet to make it fit!",
