    "summary": "Certain dishes have a special place in my heart and this is one of them. The first real restaurant job I had in San Francisco was at a small place called Ryan's Cafe. It was run by a husband and wife team, Michael and Lenore Ryan. They were true 'foodies' before that term had even been coined. This chicken Marsala dish was the most popular dish on the menu and the first one that I was taught.",

        "Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat",
