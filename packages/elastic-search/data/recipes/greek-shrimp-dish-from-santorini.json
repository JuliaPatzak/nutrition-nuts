    "summary": "An authentic Greek entree that is easy to make and makes you feel like you are in the Greek islands. My sister and I originally ate this dish at a restaurant in Santorini, Greece and went back 3 days in a row to order it again and analyze the ingredients so we could replicate it at home. It is easy to prepare ahead of time and stick in the oven so your cooking is complete before guests arrive! Serve over rice.",
