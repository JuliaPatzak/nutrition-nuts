    "summary": "A quick and simple plant-based, vegan salad that is great at room temperature or cold. I make this protein-packed dish for my kids' school lunch 2 to 3 times a month. I sometimes use small white beans when out of garbanzos, and add avocado and/or cooked quinoa, tomato, or cucumber to change it up or stretch it. It is great for picnics, potlucks, and kids' school lunches, and can be side or main dish, served on a bed of spinach, or in a wrap.",
