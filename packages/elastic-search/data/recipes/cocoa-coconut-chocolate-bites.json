    "summary": "These rich chocolates will make you look like a gourmet chocolatier. These are good for desserts with tea/coffee at a gathering. Use organic ingredients and cute paper liners to impress. Keep chilled until served as they'll begin to melt outside of the refrigerator in about 15 minutes. For this reason they're not particularly kid-friendly.",
