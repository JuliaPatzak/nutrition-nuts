    "summary": "Pizza made in the waffle iron! It's so fun to make and perfect for a busy weeknight or quick snack. I use pre-made pizza dough but your favorite homemade recipe will work just fine. Add more cheese and pepperoni if you like, it's a very versatile recipe (plus the crispy, cheesy bits are my favorite). Serve with more pizza sauce for dipping. I hope you enjoy it!",
