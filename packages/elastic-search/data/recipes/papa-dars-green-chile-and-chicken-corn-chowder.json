    "summary": "This is a totally original chowder that I came up with on my own using things that I love to cook with. Family and friends beg for this when the weather turns cold. The russet potatoes allows the liquid to thicken and no flour or corn starch is needed. New Mexico green chile is recommended. Note: if using fresh green chile, add 1/2 cup of chicken stock for added liquid. Serve with your favorite corn bread.",
