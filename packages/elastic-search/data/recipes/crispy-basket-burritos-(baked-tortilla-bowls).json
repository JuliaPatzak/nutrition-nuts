        "Gently shape the tortilla down around the sides",
        "Place a double layer of aluminum foil over the tortilla and press to form the bowl around the ramekin",
        "Place right side up on a baking sheet and leave about 1/2 inch of the edge of the tortilla above the foil so it gets browned and crispy when you bake it",
        "Repeat with the second tortilla",

        "Transfer sheet back to the oven",
        "Bake until browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes",
        "Remove sheet from oven and invert the shells once again so they are right side up",
