    "summary": "This is a wonderful, light potato salad which includes shrimp.  My mother used to make this for every picnic or potluck dinner.  Every time I take it to a potluck I get raves for it, and the recipe is always requested.  You may need to adjust the amount of mayo, depending on the size of the potatoes you use. You will use at least 2 cups, but may need to use a little more for a nice consistency.",
