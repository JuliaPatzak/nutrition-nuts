    "summary": "Ropa vieja is a traditional Cuban dish, usually made with flank steak, but I only had pot roast. It is cooked until very tender and it shreds, which is why it is called ropa vieja. Ropa vieja translates to ragged clothes or old clothes. It's very yummy, can be served over rice or even used as a filling.",
