    "summary": "This is an amazingly cheese-rich dish. I love making this to take to friends' homes as a drop off meal. It gets rave reviews every time! The recipe is adapted from a restaurant in the Mall of America called Tucci Benucch. I attended the restaurant at a business meeting and they gave us a recipe for the baked spaghetti that I have made a few changes to. My husband prefers it without the marinara/meatball topping, but if you're looking to stretch the recipe that's a great way to do it.",
