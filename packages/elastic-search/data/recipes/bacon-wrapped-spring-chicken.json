    "summary": "Stuffing a boneless, skinless chicken breast with something delicious and then wrapping it in bacon is never a bad thing. It turns a super boring, please-wake-me-up-when-it's-over piece of poultry into an exciting entree that's sure to impress. The key to this technique is keeping the knife still while creating a nice big pocket in the chicken. It is, truly, a method for all seasons.",
