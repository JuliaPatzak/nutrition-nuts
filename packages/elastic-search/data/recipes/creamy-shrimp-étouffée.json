    "summary": "Cajun or Creole, what's the difference? Well they're both cuisines in Louisiana, but the difference can be found by the addition of tomato. This \u00e9touff\u00e9e is best served with warm crusty bread to sop up the sauce. I do use tomato powder, but feel free to use tomato paste if your spice cabinet doesn't include this incredible staple. Serve over hot cooked rice.",
