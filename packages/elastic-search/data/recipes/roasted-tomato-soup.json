    "summary": "My husband wanted an easy dinner so I thought, 'How about soup and BLTs?' When I was at the grocery store, roma tomatoes were on sale and it came to me: roasted tomato soup for dinner! I already had an onion and 1/2 of a red bell pepper at home to create this flavorful soup. It is also a perfect paleo recipe for you to enjoy. Taste for any additional seasonings; serve and enjoy.",
