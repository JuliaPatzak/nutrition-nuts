    "summary": "A very good friend of mine gave me this pumpkin-pecan cookie recipe when I was searching for just the right cookie around Thanksgiving. These were by far the best I have ever tried and are simple to make. The recipe can be cut in half, because as is, it makes around 2 dozen. I would also love to know any alterations that make them any better! Enjoy!",
