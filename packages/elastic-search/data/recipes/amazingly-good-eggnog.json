    "summary": "It's taken me several years to perfect this homemade eggnog recipe. Now everyone asks, 'When are you making the eggnog?!' This uses cooked eggs for safety, and you can use more or less rum to taste.  It's a bit of work to make, but well worth it.  You'll never buy store-bought eggnog again! Enjoy!",
