    "summary": "This may look and sound sort of bad, but let me tell you, there isn't a tastier, nutritious, salsa-like dip to hold you over while you wait for dinner. Funny enough, this was created as an experiment with leftovers, and now I have over 15 friends making it on a regular basis! This is a great recipe that can be stored in the refrigerator for several days for a quick, anytime snack. (Frozen corn, heated and cooled in the same manner, may be used in place of the corn on the cob.)",
