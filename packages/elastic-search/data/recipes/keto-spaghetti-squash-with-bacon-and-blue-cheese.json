    "summary": "Turn plain old spaghetti squash into a keto meal with the addition of bacon, mushrooms, spinach, and blue cheese. I like to double the blue cheese, especially when using a milder variety. Carbs in spaghetti squash can add up quickly, so use a small squash that's approximately 2 pounds.",
