    "summary": "Umm Mm good! Peanut and curry are blended together for a very unique and creamy textured soup. It goes great with some warm sourdough bread and a light salad since it's such a rich and hearty soup! This is a very unique and definitely different recipe, but definitely will be a staple for our household!",
