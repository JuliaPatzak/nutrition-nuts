    "summary": "Covering meat with aluminum foil after removing from the grill keeps the surface from cooling off too fast while it stands. The standing time helps it retain its juices so the meat won't be dry. You can use the same method to keep hot-from-the-oven rolls or a hot side dish warm for a short time while waiting for the rest of the meal.",
