    "summary": "My grandma gave me a famous Louisiana cookbook (if you are a Louisiana native, you know what I'm talking about) when I was a teenager. I watched her make famous-around-town gumbo so many times as a kid. I took the book's \"second edition\" recipe and what I learned from her and came up with my own hybrid of the two. My daughters have asked me for my recipe, so here is my best recollection of it.",
