    "summary": "This is a halibut, mango, and papaya salad recipe that is fresh and light, especially for the spring season which will soon be upon us. Doesn't take a lot of prep time with exception of marinating the fish. Can be done ahead and kept in the fridge for at least 2 days. Salad dressing as you will see is very easy and is so delicious and light. Add fresh garlic bread or breadsticks and a glass of wine (Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc). The combination of the citrus dressing and the fruit and dill proves to be a delicious marriage of fruit and herbs. Enjoy.",
