    "summary": "Many years ago, my friend went to Spain and brought back a fantastic tapa that was made with tuna, garlic, onions, tomatoes, garlic aioli sauce. This mixture was spread on chunks of crusty bread...OH YUM. But that is not very healthy and I wanted to revamp it a little and this is what I came up with. And honestly, it comes pretty close. It is easy and tasty. I hope you like it as much as I do.",
