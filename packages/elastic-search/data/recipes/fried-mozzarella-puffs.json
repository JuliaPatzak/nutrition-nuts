    "summary": "Sometimes even the most fun of foods needs a little refresh. Not only are these mozzarella puffs crispier and more fun to eat than the original fried mozzarella stick, but they're also easier since no breading is required! I haven't forgotten the marinara sauce, but feel free to use other sauces.",
