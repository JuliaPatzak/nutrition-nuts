    "summary": "I learned how to make these from my Italian mother-in-law.  She doesn't have any of her recipes written down. She just makes them like she always has for years. They can be used in other dishes as well (bruschetta, pureed with cream over pasta, etc).  I usually just have them on the dinner table in a relish tray as a side dish to any meal.",
