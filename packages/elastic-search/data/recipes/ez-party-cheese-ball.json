    "summary": "This has been a big hit for many years as an appetizer, or just for a snack. It is always nice to have when friends drop by, and it freezes very well. If you enjoy nuts, roll the cheese ball in about a half cup of chopped pecans. Serve with crackers. Refrigerate overnight for the best flavor.",
