    "summary": "Did a lot of research on jambalaya and reviewed a number of recipes and came up with the following. I like white fish and, while not traditional, added chunks of cod fillet to this dish. You want to add the shrimp and fish to the dish with about 10 minutes to go so it does not overcook. Cook uncovered if it is soupy and covered if it is not during these last 10 minutes. Finally, try to find andouille sausage if possible. It makes all the difference.",
