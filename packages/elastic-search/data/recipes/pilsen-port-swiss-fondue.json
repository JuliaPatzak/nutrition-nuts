    "summary": "I don't know if this was done in the 70's, but I happened to throw these together for a fondue night with some really rustic sourdough and it was awesome. Port wine and beer blend with Swiss cheese in this no nonsense fondue. If round sourdough is hard to find, use a baguette sliced into rounds.",
