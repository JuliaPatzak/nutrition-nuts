    "summary": "This Bundt\u00ae cake has a hint of spice with a bit of crunch to the outside and a light texture on the inside and is made with buttermilk. Not overly sweet, so I prefer it without frosting. A nice replacement for banana bread, very moist. May add frosting or powdered sugar for presentation but this cake is excellent by itself.",
