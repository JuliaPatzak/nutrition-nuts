    "summary": "While it may sound like a plain, generic item you see on a menu at the food court at the mall, honey-garlic shrimp is actually one of the most exciting and delicious garlic shrimp recipes I know. It's the perfect balance of sweet and savory while still packing a substantial garlic punch, plus it's extremely fast and simple to make. This recipe uses half the honey that typical recipes use and allows the natural sweetness of the shrimp to shine through. Serve over hot cooked rice or the starchy base of your choice such as noodles.",
