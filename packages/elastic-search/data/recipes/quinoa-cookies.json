    "summary": "I bake with my three-year-old at least once a week. We have tried a plethora of different cookies with different fruits and bases. This one was a hit! My three-year-old and older child both loved these, and I did too! They are super simple to make and sneak fiber, protein, and other nutrients into dessert! I used one cookie sheet for nine cookies, three rows of three fit well.",
