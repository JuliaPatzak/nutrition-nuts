        "Pack the zucchini and onion into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top with pickling liquid",
        "Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles",

        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool",
