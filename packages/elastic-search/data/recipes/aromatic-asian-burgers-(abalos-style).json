    "summary": "The nutty smell of the sesame oil permeates the kitchen as these burgers are frying. While not authentically Asian, the taste distinctly hints at the flavors of the East. I created this recipe when I accidentally thawed out ground beef instead of chicken breast. Naturally, burgers were the quickest and easiest option. Serve in burger buns topped with teriyaki sauce Sriracha\u00ae sauce as condiments.",
