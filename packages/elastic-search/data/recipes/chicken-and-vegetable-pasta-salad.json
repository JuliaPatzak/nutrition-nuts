    "summary": "Chicken, vegetables and pasta make up this filling salad which everyone seems to like, even people who don't like pasta salad. This is great for hot summer days when you just don't feel like turning on the oven. Note: the amounts here are estimates, as I rarely measure when I make this salad, so feel free to add a bit more or less of whatever you please.",
