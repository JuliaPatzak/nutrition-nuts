    "summary": "A whole head of garlic sounds like a lot for hummus but roasting it makes it very mellow, so the hummus is not garlicky at all. Like in hummus with chickpeas, I always add a little homemade harissa, which gives it great flavor without making it spicy. It's not worth turning on the oven for just one head of garlic so I always roast 3 or 4 heads at a time and use them within a week or so. This hummus keeps for 3 to 4 days, refrigerated.",
