    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound minced bacon",
        "1 large onion, minced",
        "2 tablespoons dry mustard",
        "\u00bc teaspoon ground nutmeg",
        "1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese",
        "\u00bd cup sour cream",
        "1 tablespoon mayonnaise",
        "3 (4 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls, or as needed"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Cook and stir bacon, onion, dry mustard, and nutmeg in a large skillet over medium-low heat until caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes",
        "Squish the bacon mixture to one side in the pan and set the pan at an angle so the grease drains to the bottom",
        "Discard grease and let bacon mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Combine cooled bacon mixture, mozzarella, sour cream, and mayonnaise in a large bowl",
        "Mix together until the consistency is thick like a paste",
        "Open 1 can of crescent rolls (keep the others in the fridge until you are ready to open them) and separate each triangle",
        "Use a pizza cutter to cut each triangle into 5 strips by cutting it 3 times across diagonally, and then cutting the 2 longer strips in half",
        "Take about 1 teaspoon of the filling and wrap a crescent dough strip around it, stretching it if needed",
        "It doesn't matter if the filling is poking out of the bottom",
        "Line them up on a baking tray and squish the tops flat so they stay upright",
        "Repeat with remaining cans of dough and filling",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes"
