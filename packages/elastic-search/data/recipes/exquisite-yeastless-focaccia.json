    "summary": "This recipe for focaccia was given to me by my best friend, who is Italian.  It's incredibly simple, with only a few ingredients for the bread, and very versatile.  I love it because there's no yeast, and it's just so easy to make!  You can top it off with vegetables when there are about 5 minutes left on the baking time, or you can just season it with herbs and Parmesan cheese--my personal favorite.",
