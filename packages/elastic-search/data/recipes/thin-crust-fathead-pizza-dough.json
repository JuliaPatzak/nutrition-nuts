    "summary": "Made without cream cheese, this crust is not only keto-friendly but also tastes just like pizza! Even though it's thin, the xanthan gum helps make it sturdy enough to pick up and hold all your favorite pizza toppings. Note that the yeast won't help the dough rise since it's lacking sugar to activate it; it is solely included to add traditional bread-like flavor. Shred your own mozzarella from a block of cheese instead of buying pre-shredded; the latter does not melt well.",
