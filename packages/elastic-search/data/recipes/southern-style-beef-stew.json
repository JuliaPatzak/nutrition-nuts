    "summary": "This is how my mother in law makes beef stew and she is from Alabama. As southern as you can get. Do not use generic tomatoes, they make this bland. I use arm shoulder roast and cut it up cause some beef stew meat is too tough. You can also make this with turtle meat and call it turtle stew, that's what we do! You can adjust the ingredients according to your own taste. We love to eat this with buttered bread.",
