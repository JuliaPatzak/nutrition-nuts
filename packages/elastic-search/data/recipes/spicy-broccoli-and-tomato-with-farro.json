    "summary": "I wanted to make a pasta salad, but didn't feel like going shopping, so I rummaged through my kitchen to see what was available that could be done in less than an hour - difficult for me, since I like to cook from scratch as much as possible! I ate it as a main dish, but it would also make a great side dish. The chile paste recipe came from an online guide to pickled mangoes. The mangoes didn't come out well, so I use the chile paste to add a kick to any of my recipes.",
