    "summary": "This homemade pineapple ice cream is reminiscent of the infamous 'Dole Whip' at Disney\u00ae. This version packs great pineapple flavor but it more smooth and creamy. Make this a float by dishing the ice cream into a glass and pour pineapple juice over it and top with whipped cream. This is a refreshing summer treat!",
