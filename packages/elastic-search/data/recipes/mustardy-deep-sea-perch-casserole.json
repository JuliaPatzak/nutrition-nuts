    "summary": "When you read this recipe, this combination might sound really weird, but if you like mustard and bananas, it's really worth a try.  I've served it a number of times and everybody is quite surprised about it.  I use deep sea perch fillet or sometimes cod fillet, but any other fish with this kind of texture is alright to use (don't use an oily fish like salmon or trout).  For mustard, try not to use sweet mustard, because the bananas are sweet already and the dish might end up too sweet.  Serves well with rice.",
