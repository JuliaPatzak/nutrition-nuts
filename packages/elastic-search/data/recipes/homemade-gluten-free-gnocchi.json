    "summary": "There is nothing like homemade gnocchi. They taste like potatoes with a bouncy texture, even without gluten. This gluten-free version uses a trick from the past when Italian cooks would toss potatoes into a fire or oven that was being cooled down so as not to waste the heat. Surplus baked potatoes became gnocchi because they have very little moisture (the secret to firm gnocchi) and they have a roasted potato flavor, taking your dish one step farther.",
