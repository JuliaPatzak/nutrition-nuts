    "summary": "Other recipes on this site for mayo just were not thick-n'-tangy enough. This recipe must use only egg yolks for maximum thickness. For those who want no waste, take those egg whites and cook yourself some eggs. I also don't recommend using a blender. I tried and got mayo on my face.",
