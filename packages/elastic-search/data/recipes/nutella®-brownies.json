    "summary": "These moist, fudgy brownies started out as an impromptu experiment when I realized too late I was out of baking chocolate. Now it's one of my favorite brownie recipes! The Nutella\u00ae and Frangelico\u00ae give them a distinctly nutty flavor without interrupting the smooth texture. I love these brownies with cold milk or hot coffee.",
