    "summary": "One Halloween I decided to try out a macaroni and cheese recipe using pumpkin, and it turned out to be a huge hit. The combination of the cheeses and the pumpkin made it so very rich and creamy. The next time I decided to make this dish I added some cooked lobster I had left over, and from there I just fell in love. I have had lobster macaroni and cheese dishes before, but never anything like this. All of this may sound strange and unusual but once you try this dish you will never get it out of your head. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with fresh bread or dinner rolls.",
