    "summary": "This is the essential homemade tomato soup recipe. It's time consuming because everything is from scratch, but very easy to make and easy to customize. You'll need a blender, mesh strainer, and two large pots. If you're cooking for fewer, cut the recipe in half. Top with seasoned croutons, crackers, pumpkin seeds, or feta cheese. The kids like to add Goldfish\u00ae crackers. You can be fancy and garnish with basil leaves also.",
