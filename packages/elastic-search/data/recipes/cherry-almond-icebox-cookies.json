    "summary": "This is my Grandmother's recipe, at least 50 years old, a classic cherry almond icebox cookie that I turned into a bar cookie. I also dip or drizzle white chocolate on the cooled cookies to make them a little more fancy for Christmas cookie exchanges. But it's delicious either way!",
