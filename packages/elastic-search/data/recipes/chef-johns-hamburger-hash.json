    "summary": "Move over corned beef, because there's a new hash in town! If you like hash, you are going to love this version made with ground beef instead of corned. Making a hash is basically a 3-step process: frying your meat and potatoes, adding onions and mushrooms, and then adding quick-cooking vegetables like peppers. But take a look in the fridge and use any ingredients you'd like because in the game of hash, whoever has the most ingredients wins! Top with a cayenne-dusted poached egg and green onions if you'd like.",
