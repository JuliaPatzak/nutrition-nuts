    "ingredients": [
        "2 tablespoons butter",
        "1  onion, finely chopped",
        "1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth",
        "1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes",
        "1  orange, juiced",
        "1  orange, juiced and zested",
        "3 tablespoons sour cream",
        "salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Melt butter in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes",
        "Pour in the chicken broth, and stir in the butternut squash cubes, orange juice, and orange zest",
        "Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the squash cubes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes",
        "Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree",
        "Puree in batches until smooth and pour back into the pot",
        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot",
        "Whisk in sour cream until smooth, and season to taste with salt and pepper",
        "Heat over medium-low heat until almost simmering, and serve hot"
