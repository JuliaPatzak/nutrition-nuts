    "summary": "This is a healthier version of honey-sesame chicken that's pan-fried instead of deep-fried--an easy, home-cooked meal that's salty, sweet, and a little bit spicy. It's a combination of flavors so deliciously right that you'll never think about Asian takeout again. Serve over rice or noodles, and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion slices.",
