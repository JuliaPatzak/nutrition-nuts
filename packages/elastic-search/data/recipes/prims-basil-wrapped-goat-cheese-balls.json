    "summary": "One of the very first mentions of food in 'The Hunger Games' trilogy comes in the form of a gift from Prim. On Reaping Day, Prim presents her beloved big sister with a gift \u2013 goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Historically, goats represent sacrifice and giving, and when Prim gives Katniss this goat cheese she foreshadows the many sacrifices the Everdeen family will be forced to make when Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place in the Hunger Games.",
