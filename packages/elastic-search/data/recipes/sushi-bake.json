    "summary": "Savory and satisfying, this easy-to-make dish is a local favorite in Hawaii. This is the only dish I bring to parties anymore. Even at a smaller gathering, I get to take home a clean baking dish at the end of the night. Like most casseroles, this dish is very forgiving, so don't sweat it if you can't find an ingredient or aren't sure about the quantities.",
