    "summary": "Unable to find a recipe for kale using what ingredients I had on hand, I decided to be creative. Amazingly, it was delicious! I didn't use any salt or pepper and yet the taste was not at all bland. The kale was very tender but not soupy. This will definitely be a go-to recipe for kale.",
