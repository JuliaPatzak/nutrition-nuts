    "summary": "This is a homemade version of the Twin Bing\u00ae candy bars from the 60s. They are rich and sweet and a small piece is a nice treat. These really are like candy, so cut in small pieces. A 1-inch square is sufficient! Store in a cool place in an airtight container, separating layers with waxed paper.",
