    "summary": "This is a large-batch hearty vegetarian salad with the bold flavors of Mexican chorizo sausage (without the meat). It's filling but low in calories. It's smoky, peppery, with bright acidity, and best of all, it has a satisfying crunch that doesn't wilt. It's great for parties since everything is chopped or diced, so it's not awkward to eat, and the crunch will last all day. You can even prepare it the night before with out worrying about a weak wilted salad.",
