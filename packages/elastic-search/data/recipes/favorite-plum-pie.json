    "summary": "I know there are lots of pie recipes on AllRecipes.com. I only found one for classic plum pie, and lots for cherry pie, but each had features I didn't care for, so I combined what I thought were the best parts, and this is the result. This recipe is easily doubled, tripled, or whatever, depending on the amount of fruit you have.",
