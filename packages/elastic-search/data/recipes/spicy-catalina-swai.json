    "summary": "Tasty grilled fish fillet with a tantalizing color and zesty, zingy taste. I love to experiment with grilling fish and marinades, and this is one I've recently come up with. Recipe also works well with trout; haven't tried it with other types of fish, though. If cooking more than one fish, grill each in separate foil to preserve flavor.",
