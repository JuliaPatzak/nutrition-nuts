    "summary": "I came up with this recipe, since it's hard to find quick-and-easy snacks without gluten or peanuts. These bars are so good that even my friends who don't have food allergies love them! If you have tree-nut allergies, you can substitute sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds. There are so many variations on this recipe!",
