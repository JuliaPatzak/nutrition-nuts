This soup is an example of a happy and delicious combination of flavors. I know it's a lot of ingredients, but it's well worth the effort.

        "Stir in the green onions, cauliflower, parsnip, and mushrooms, and cook and stir an additional 5 minutes",
        "Add the pear, beans, mustard, and dill, and stir just until heated, about 1 minute",
