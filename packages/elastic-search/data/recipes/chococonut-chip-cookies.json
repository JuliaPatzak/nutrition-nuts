    "summary": "I came up with this scrumptious recipe one day, just trying to find a way to use the bag of coconut flakes sitting in the cupboard.  It was just a cross between family recipes for cookies and my own special touch of imagination.  Well I'm glad that I came up with it as are my family and friends.  I hope you enjoy as much as we did.",
