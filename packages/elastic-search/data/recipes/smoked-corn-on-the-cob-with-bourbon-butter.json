    "summary": "Sweet summer corn is lightly smoked and covered in a subtle, yet delicious bourbon-cinnamon butter. If you already have other foods going in your smoker at a higher temp, throw the corn in - just reduce the time slightly. I like using maple or fruit woods, but for a smokier flavor, use hickory or mesquite.",
