    "summary": "Tostones are made with green (unripe) plantains and are a very popular side dish in many Caribbean and South American countries. The traditional method is to twice-fry the plantains in oil, but this air-fried version of my Puerto Rican family's recipe is much lighter as it uses olive oil spray instead of deep-frying.",
