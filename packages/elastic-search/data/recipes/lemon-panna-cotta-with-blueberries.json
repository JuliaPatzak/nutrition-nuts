    "summary": "This creamy, tart, and lightly sweet dessert is much easier to make than you might think! Serve with some fresh fruit for some added sweetness to balance out the tartness of the lemon. While the recipe describes how to remove the panna cotta from the molds for serving, they can also be served directly in the ramekins with the fruit on top for ease (I would use slightly larger ramekins in this case).",

    "ingredients": [
        "cooking spray",
        "\u00bc cup fresh lemon juice",
        "1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin",
        "2 cups heavy whipping cream",
        "1 cup half-and-half",
        "2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest, plus more for garnish",
        "\u2153 cup granulated sugar",
        "\u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "6 leaves fresh mint"

    "directions": [
        "Lightly oil or spray six 6 ounce ramekins",
        "Pour lemon juice in a small bowl and sprinkle with gelatin",
        "Let sit for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin; mix well",
        "Set aside",
        "Stir together heavy cream, half and half, and lemon zest in a saucepan over low heat",
        "Add sugar, stirring frequently, until sugar has dissolved completely",
        "Heat mixture slowly until it just about to boil, about 15 minutes",
        "Remove from heat",
        "Whisk gelatin mixture and vanilla extract into the cream mixture until well blended and gelatin is completely dissolved",
        "Keep lightly whisking until the mixture comes close to room temperature, about 10 minutes",
        "This will prevent the gelatin and cream from separating while the panna cotta is setting",
        "Divide mixture into ramekins, about 1/2 cup per portion",
        "Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 4 hours",
        "Run a knife around the inside edges of the ramekin to remove panna cotta from the ramekins",
        "Carefully dip each ramekin into a bowl of hot water for a few seconds",
        "Carefully invert onto serving plates, tap, and jiggle the ramekin a bit if needed for the panna cotta to come loose",
        "Garnish with additional lemon zest and mint leaves, and serve with fresh blueberries"
