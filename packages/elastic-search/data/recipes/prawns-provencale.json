    "summary": "I learned how to make these prawns working for a caterer back in the '80s. Be sure to season the breadcrumbs well. Butterflying the prawns takes time, but practically everything except the baking can be done ahead of time. Serve with any number of dips (like lemon aioli) or just a squeeze of fresh lemon.",
