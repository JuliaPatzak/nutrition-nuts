    "summary": "The first time I tried this chili I was floored! It has wonderful flavors, and is very spicy and very addictive. If you don't like heat, adjust the ingredients. It's perfect at a football tailgate party or picnic. If you like a roasted flavor, bake the garlic before pressing it. For the beer, a hoppy pale ale works well, as does a dark stout. I've also experimented with adding a cup of coffee to the mix to give it a roasted coffee flavor. It also freezes well.",
