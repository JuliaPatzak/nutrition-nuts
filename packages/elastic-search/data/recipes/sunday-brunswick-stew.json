    "summary": "This is a sweet and spicy stew that you start in the morning and let the slow cooker do the rest. It is a great way to bring in the fall season because it is packed full of vegetables, pork, and butternut squash. It is perfect paired with cornbread muffins and a great way to use leftover pork roast or pulled pork barbeque! White potatoes can be substituted for the butternut squash.",
