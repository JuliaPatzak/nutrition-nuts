    "summary": "Delicious tender beef cooked in the slow cooker with beer, shallots, bacon, and mushrooms. The Guiness\u00ae makes a lovely gravy without tasting overly strong of beer. This is quite a meaty dish so would also be nice with potatoes and carrots added. I serve this with crusty French bread to mop up the juices. Hearty and warming to come home to. Cooks in 5 hours in the slow cooker; however it would not hurt it to be cooked all day.",
