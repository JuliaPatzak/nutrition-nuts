    "summary": "Mustard based sauces are definitively South Carolina. This one will definitely satisfy your needs. This is for the big fatty ribs, not the baby backs. Do not trim the fat from the ribs. This method renders out fat and keeps ribs moist. If you do not have a smoker available, this can also be done in the oven.",
