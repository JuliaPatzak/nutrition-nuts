        "Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler",
        "Rub salmon down in olive oil",
        "Cut your lemon in half and set 1 half off to the side",
        "Cut the other half into 1/4-inch thick slices",
        "Lay them on a broiler pan and lay the salmon on top of them",
        "You just need enough to cover the bottom of the salmon so it's not touching the pan",
        "Sprinkle with dill, garlic powder, salt, and pepper",
