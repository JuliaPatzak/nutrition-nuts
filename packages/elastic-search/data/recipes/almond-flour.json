    "summary": "I use almond flour with many of my recipes but it is very costly. I want to experiment with a few inspirations for the holidays therefore decided to make my own almond flour. I had a huge bag that I purchased a while ago to make a nut crunch. I used my food processor but I bet you can do the same with a coffee grinder as well. My advice would be to pulse it because I fear if you over blend you will end up with almond butter. It came out perfectly so now off to cooking land!",
