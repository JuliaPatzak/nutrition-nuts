    "summary": "These crispy fried meatballs are traditionally made by grinding up the leftover trimmings from a butcher shop, and while our version won't have the same diversity of meats, at least we'll know for sure what's in it. At Fern Bar in Sebastopol, where I stole the idea, they'll switch up the ingredients depending on what's around, as well as change the sauce underneath. Garnish these nuggets with pickled vegetables and olives.",
