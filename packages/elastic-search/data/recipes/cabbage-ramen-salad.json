    "summary": "So refreshing and colorful! Great as a side dish or a salad on its own. A 'slap-chop' works great if you have one. When I bring this to a party, I keep the oils, veggies, seeds, ramen, and sugar in separate bags until it's time to mix and serve. It tastes better to me when I don't mix the sugar with the oil right away.",
