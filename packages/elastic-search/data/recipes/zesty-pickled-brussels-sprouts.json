        "5  1-pint canning jars with lids and rings",
        "5 cloves garlic, divided",
        "1\u2009\u00bc teaspoons red pepper flakes, divided",

    "directions": [
        "Soak Brussels sprouts in a large bowl filled with lightly salted water for about 15 minutes",
        "Drain well",
        "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes",
        "Divide the drained Brussels sprouts evenly between jars, filling the jars about 3/4-inch from the top",
        "Place 1 garlic clove and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes in each jar",
        "Bring vinegar, water, and pickling salt to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat until the salt is dissolved, about 5 minutes",
        "Pour the vinegar mixture into the jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top",
        "Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles",
        "Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue",
        "Top with lids, and screw on rings",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot, and fill stockpot halfway with water",
        "Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder",
        "Leave a 2-inch space between the jars",
        "Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars",
        "Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes",
        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool",
        "Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)",
        "Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 3 weeks before opening"
