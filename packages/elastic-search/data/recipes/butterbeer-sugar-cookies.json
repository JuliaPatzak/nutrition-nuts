    "summary": "After a spring break trip to Universal Studios\u00ae Wizarding World of Harry Potter, I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to try my hand at making a butterbeer-flavored cookie. After a few test batches, this recipe was finally approved by my family of extremely picky Harry Potter fans as being the perfect cookie recreation: lightly butterscotchy, with vanilla and brown sugar accents, just like the Wizarding World drink!",
