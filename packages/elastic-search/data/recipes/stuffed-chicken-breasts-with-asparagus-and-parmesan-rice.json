        "2 cups chicken broth",

    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface",
        "Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch",
        "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the asparagus, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper just until the asparagus is bright green and beginning to become tender, about 5 minutes",
        "Remove from heat",
        "Lay each chicken breast out onto a work surface, and place a slice of ham on the flattened breast",
        "Place 1/4 of the asparagus mixture over the ham, and top with 1/4 of the Cheddar cheese",
        "Roll the chicken breast around the filling and secure with toothpicks or tie with cotton kitchen string; place the stuffed breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, seam sides down",
        "Top each breast with about 1/2 tablespoon of butter",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 30 to 40 minutes",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a stuffed breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)",
        "Baste the stuffed chicken breasts occasionally with pan juices while baking",
        "While chicken is baking, bring chicken broth and 1 tablespoon of butter to a boil in a saucepan",
        "Stir in rice and tomatoes, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook the rice until tender and the broth has been absorbed, about 20 minutes",
        "Remove from heat, and let rice stand covered for about 5 minutes; stir in Parmesan cheese",
        "Serve stuffed chicken breasts on the cooked rice"
