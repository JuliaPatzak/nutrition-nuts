    "summary": "Russians call it 'Korean Carrot Salad,' but it is so absolutely ubiquitous in Russia that if they didn't originally own it, they certainly do now. Coriander provides primary flavor; cayenne provides the heat. To get it right, you MUST use a mandoline to julienne the carrots into long, thin strands like spaghetti. To save time, buy them already julienned at the grocery store. This dish is best after it has marinated for 24 hours, but is fine after only 4 or 5 hours.",
