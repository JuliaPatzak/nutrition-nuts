    "summary": "This is my wing recipe that I've tweaked over the last 10 years to suit my specific tastes.  If you don't like vinegar and cayenne; these wings will not be for you.  I've never seen a middle ground with this recipe; they are either raved about or politely passed up.  If you like a hotter wing experience, double the amounts of chili powder and cayenne powder. Enjoy with chunky blue cheese or ranch dressing.",
