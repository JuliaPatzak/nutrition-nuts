    "summary": "I recently took a weekend trip, and I experienced one of the best meals of my life at a fine little establishment that specializes in Southern cuisine. One of the things that made this meal so memorable was the praline bacon that I had, so I took it upon myself to recreate it.  The only difference is that I like mine better.",
