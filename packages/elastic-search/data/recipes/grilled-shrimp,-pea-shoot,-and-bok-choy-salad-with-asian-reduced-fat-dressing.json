    "summary": "This is the tastiest shrimp salad without any guilt: only a trace of oil makes it perfect for serving any dieter. If you want to feel healthy, but enjoy your food, this is the salad for you. You may want to garnish with additional green onions and chopped peanuts, but I find that placing the shrimp on the top is garnish enough.",
