    "summary": "Delicata squash is a small oblong squash that has pale yellow skin with dark green stripes. It's sweet and smooth enough to eat plain, but the flavor really pops with this medley of shrimp and veggies. This recipe was a clean-out-my-freezer concoction that turned out to be tasty. For a light colorful meal, serve with a salad of mixed baby greens, cucumber, and toasted pine nuts.",
