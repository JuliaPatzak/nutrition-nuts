    "summary": "Don't worry; this recipe has nothing to do with those creepy dolls. This is one of easiest and most delicious ways you can cook fish. The leaf not only keeps the halibut moist, but also holds all your assorted garnishes and seasonings tight against the meat, which creates an even more intensely flavored result. The lovely aroma of cabbage will mask those fishy smells that usually linger in the kitchen. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.",
