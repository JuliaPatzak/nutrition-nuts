    "summary": "This recipe is a strong family favourite. It's great to warm you up on cold winter evenings, or in the summer served with a fresh green salad. You can use Cheddar instead of Red Leicester if you prefer. A plain bechamel sauce is also tasty, but add a little more nutmeg. If sauce making is scary, this dish works just as well with a tin of smoked fish chowder or packet sauce.",
