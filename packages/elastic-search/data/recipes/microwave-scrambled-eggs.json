    "summary": "Scrambled eggs have long been a staple for most breakfasts, and most people add assorted ingredients to make their eggs extra fluffy, but this recipe is your basic scrambled eggs with just salt and pepper. If you want to add anything, add butter. Unlike milk, which will dilute the flavor and cause rubbery eggs, butter will make them creamy. Don't want to microwave them? Cook them on the stovetop over medium heat.",
