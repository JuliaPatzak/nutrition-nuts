    "summary": "This is an easy yogurt cake that uses the yogurt container to measure all of the ingredients. It's ready in under an hour and the perfect not-too-sweet snack or breakfast treat. It's known in France as \"G\u00e2teau au Yaourt\" and is typically the first cake that French children learn how to make. My son attends a French school and has made this with his classmates.",
