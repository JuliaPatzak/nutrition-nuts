    "summary": "Rice infused with garlic and onion baked in chicken stock. A wonderfully simple dish even picky eaters will enjoy. I use homemade stock as it's the most flavorful, but use whatever you have on hand. Another option is adding whatever leftover veggies or meat I have to make a simple casserole without a heavy cream sauce. This recipe uses a rice-to-liquid ratio of 2:1 for long-grain rice.",
