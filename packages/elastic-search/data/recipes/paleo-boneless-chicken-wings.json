    "summary": "I was laughing to myself while making these because there is really no such thing as a boneless chicken wing. But we are using the same method and using boneless chicken. I love chicken wings and so do millions of others but when entertaining at home, I don't like to make them because of the mess. The bones that we need to discard, the big pan to fry the wings in, and of course all of the sticky fingers! My Paleo boneless chicken recipe is not only healthy and easy to make but just pop in toothpicks and there won't be any sticky marks in your house. I hope you enjoy my version!",
