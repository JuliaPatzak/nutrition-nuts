    "directions": [
        "Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C)",
        "Mix the 16 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of minced oregano, 2 teaspoons of salt, and pepper in a bowl",
        "Rub garlic mixture over the pork butt, and place pork in a shallow roasting pan",
        "Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Continue roasting until pork is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours and 15 minutes",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)",
        "Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 20 minutes before rough chopping or shredding it",
        "Reserve pan drippings",
        "Place the chipotle peppers in a bowl, and cover with hot water",
        "Allow peppers to soak until softened, about 3 minutes; drain",
        "Set aside",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat",
        "Stir in 8 cloves of minced garlic and the chopped onions; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes",
        "Stir in the Roma tomatoes, 1 cup of water, chipotle chili peppers, 5 teaspoons of oregano, sugar, and salt to taste",
        "Add the reserved pan drippings",
        "Simmer, uncovered, over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently",
        "Pour the chipotle sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree",
        "Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot",
        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the sauce right in the skillet",
        "Strain the sauce through a sieve",
        "To serve: Hollow out the bottom half of each bolillo to make a shallow bowl for the chopped pork",
        "Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the chipotle sauce over the bottom of each roll, then arrange the chopped pork over the sauce",
        "Top each sandwich with a couple slices of pickled jalapeno, followed by the top half of the roll",
        "Pour about 1/4 cup of additional chipotle sauce over the entire sandwich"
