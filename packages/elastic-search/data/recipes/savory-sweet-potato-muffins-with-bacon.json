    "summary": "When I lived in New Zealand, there was an abundance of kumara (their version of our sweet potato) and it was used in everything from curries to muffins. I came up with this recipe to fuse those two ideas, but mainly to appeal to my then 2-year-old, a picky eater who loved finger foods. I serve it with fruit for a complete meal.",
