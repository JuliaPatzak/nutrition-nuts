    "summary": "A fantastic variation of a simple but delicious Italian dish, my Puttanesca is a mildly spicy white wine tomato sauce with fresh garlic, mushrooms, capers, and anchovy-stuffed green olives. The anchovy-stuffed green olives are easy to find next to the rest of the canned olives at any major grocery store.",
