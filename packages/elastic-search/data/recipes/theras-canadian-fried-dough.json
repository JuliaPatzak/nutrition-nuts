    "summary": "If you have ever been in Canada, especially Ottawa, Ontario, we have a pastry called BeaverTails\u00ae -- a whole-wheat pastry, fried and covered in an assortment of goodies. The Indians originally made these, but they were called pigs' ears. Over the years I have perfected the recipe to the point where I and my friends no longer go out to get them. I just make 'em at home! Enjoy, EH!",

    "directions": [
        "Mix warm water, yeast, and 1 pinch of sugar in a large bowl, and let stand until the yeast begins to foam and form a creamy layer, about 5 minutes",
        "Stir in milk, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and 1/3 cup vegetable oil until the sugar has dissolved",
        "Mix in about half the whole-wheat flour, and stir until the dough is too stiff to add more flour",
        "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead in more flour until the dough is no longer sticky",
        "Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes",
        "Form the dough into a ball, place into an oiled bowl, and cover",
        "Let rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour",

        "Roll the dough ball out into an oval shape about 1/4 inch thick",
        "Place finished fried dough on a cloth and cover while you finish rolling out the pastries",
        "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Oil should be at least 4 inches deep",
        "Combine 2 cups of sugar with cinnamon to taste in a shallow dish or pie plate, and set aside",
        "Gently lower the pastries, one at a time, into the hot oil, and fry 1 to 2 minutes per side until golden brown",
