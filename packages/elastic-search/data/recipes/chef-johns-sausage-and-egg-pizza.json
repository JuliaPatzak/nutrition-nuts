        "Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C)",

        "Transfer sausage slices to a paper towel-lined plate to drain",
        "Roll pizza dough out to about 12 inches in diameter and about 3/8-inch thick; sprinkle with cornmeal",
        "Flip dough so the cornmeal side is down and transfer to a perforated 14-inch pizza pan",
        "Spread pizza sauce in a thin layer on top of the dough",
        "Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and about 3/4 the Fontina cheese",
        "Spread sausage slices onto the pizza, leaving 4 spaces about 3 inches across on the pizza for eggs",
