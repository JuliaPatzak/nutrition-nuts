    "summary": "Cooler weather has arrived, and as always, my mind wanders to fall produce with apples at the top of the list. These tender, lightly sweetened, moist muffins taste like carrot cake, spice cake, and apple cake combined. These muffins freeze well and can be quickly reheated in the microwave on a low temperature for a quick breakfast.",
