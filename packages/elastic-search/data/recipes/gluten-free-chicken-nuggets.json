    "summary": "My 2-year-old was diagnosed with Celiac. After experimenting with several failed chicken nugget recipes, I finally came up with one the whole family loves. This is a mild-tasting chicken nugget designed for a 2-year-old. Some additional seasoning added to the Chex\u00ae should give it a more 'grown up' flavor.",
