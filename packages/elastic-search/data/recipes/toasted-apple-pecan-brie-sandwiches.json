    "summary": "I came up with this recipe one night for dinner and my husband and family loved it and it has become a regular for us. The combination of spiced apples and brie cheese is amazing.  Great served with a spring lettuce salad.  You can also make this as an appetizer by using a baguette loaf instead of sourdough slices.",
