I really love making anything Hungarian, since the recipes tend to be simple and easy to make, as well as comforting and delicious, and the names are never not fun to say. Top with extra sour cream and freshly sliced chives on top.",

        "Season chicken generously on both sides with salt",
        "Heat olive oil in a heavy, deep-sided pan (that comes with a lid) over high heat and brown the chicken well, skin-side down, about 5 minutes; flip and continue to sear until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more",

        "Skim some fat off the top of the sauce if desired",
        "Whisk heavy cream and sour cream into the sauce and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally",

        "Simmer, uncovered, basting often, until chicken is heated through and very tender, about 10 minutes",
