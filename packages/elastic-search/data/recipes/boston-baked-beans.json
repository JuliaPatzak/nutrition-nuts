    "summary": "A wonderful old-fashioned baked bean flavor. This recipe has served by family for 29 years and originally came from my mother-in-law.  It tastes great served with fresh cornbread or biscuits and honey. Although you need to allow time for soaking and simmering the beans, this recipe is still quite easy.",
