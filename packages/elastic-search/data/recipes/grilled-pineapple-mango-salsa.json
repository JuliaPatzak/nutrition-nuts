    "summary": "This salsa is so easy to make and versatile too. Add what you like, leave out what you don't like. It should taste as fresh as summer! Great with fish, chicken, pork, chips, or just with a spoon! This is a do ahead recipe for sure.  It taste better the next day.  Play with this salsa, I have added grapes, apples, dried cranberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, watermelon; just balance sweet with acid of lime or lemon. Have fun with it!",
