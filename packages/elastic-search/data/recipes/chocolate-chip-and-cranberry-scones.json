        "\u00bd teaspoon salt",

    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a food processor; add butter and process until the resulting mixture resembles breadcrumbs",
        "Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl",
        "Stir chocolate chips and cranberries into the flour mixture",
        "Add almond milk 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing it into the flour mixture with your hands or a spoon",
        "Whisk almond milk and vanilla extract together in a small bowl and stir into the mixture with the final addition of almond milk, kneading the resulting dough by hand until it begins to come together, adding extra almond milk as needed to make it moist enough to be workable",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into 11 golf ball-sized spheres and flatten so they resemble a pancake about 3/4-inch thick; arrange onto a baking sheet",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes"
