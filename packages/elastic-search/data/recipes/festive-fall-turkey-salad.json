    "summary": "I created this recipe to use leftover holiday turkey. It's a classic bound salad using mayonnaise and celery, but it also includes fresh cranberries, orange juice and cashews. Although new to our menu, it has become a holiday favorite. My family requests I make my own turkey before Thanksgiving so I can serve this salad as an appetizer at our holiday feast. I hope you will find it as enjoyable as we do. Enjoy it on rolls, in wraps, or as a spread with crackers.",
