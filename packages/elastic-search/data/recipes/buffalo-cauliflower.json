    "summary": "This is a great substitution for buffalo wings! Can be made gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. Make sure to coat your cookie sheet well with oil or they will stick. Husband and kids give this two thumbs up! Dip this in ranch or blue cheese for even more added flavor, but it doesn't need it.",
