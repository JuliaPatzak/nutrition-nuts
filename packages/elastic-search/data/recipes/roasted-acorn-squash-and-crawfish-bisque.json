        "Cook in the microwave on High until the butter has completely melted",
        "Place the acorn squash cut side up onto the aluminum foil; brush with the brown sugar mixture",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the squash is tender and golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours",
        "Remove from the oven, allow to cool, and scoop out and reserve the flesh",
        "Melt the remaining 1/4 cup of butter in a large pot over medium heat",

        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot",
        "Once pureed, add the crawfish tails, and simmer a few minutes until hot"
