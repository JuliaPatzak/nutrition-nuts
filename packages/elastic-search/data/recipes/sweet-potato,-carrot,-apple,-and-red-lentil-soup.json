        "Melt the butter in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat",
        "Place the chopped sweet potatoes, carrots, apple, and onion in the pot",
        "Stir and cook the apples and vegetables until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes",

        "Bring the soup to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils and vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes",
        "Working in batches, pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree",

        "Bring back to a simmer over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes",
        "Add water as needed to thin the soup to your preferred consistency",
