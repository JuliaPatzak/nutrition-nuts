    "summary": "This was a recipe my Mom had and we ate it every St. Patrick's Day.  An alternative recipe for St. Patrick's Day for those who don't care for corned beef and cabbage.  Cooked together in one pot and boy is it juicy! My mom is Irish and hated the traditional corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage version. She got the basis for this recipe from her Italian Mother in Law. Add a nice warm crusty roll, butter, and a pint of Guinness or Pinot Noir and you got yourself a hearty meal to celebrate the Irish!",
