    "summary": "This is a recipe I made up because I really wanted some salsa and tortillas; however, I was out of salsa. Tomato and celery along with some other ingredients are sauteed in oil and then simmered in tomato juice. It's a quick fix when you have no salsa. Warm tortilla chips go well with this salsa. Just pop some chips in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes until lightly browned.",
