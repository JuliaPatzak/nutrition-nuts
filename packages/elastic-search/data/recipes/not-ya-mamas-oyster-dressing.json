    "summary": "Thirty-five years ago, a group of friends went to a little Italian restaurant south of New Orleans. We all fell in love with their oyster dressing. We ate it so often the guys made a bet to see who could duplicate the recipe. After many tries, one of our friends figured it out and won the bet. During this time I was pregnant with my son and I craved oysters any way but raw. My husband made this for me at least twice a week (35-year-old son came into this world loving oysters). Last year I found the original restaurant recipe in a New Orleans cookbook; our friend hit the nail on the head. This is his version.",
