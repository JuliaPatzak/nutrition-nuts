    "summary": "Almond flour is the secret ingredient in these crisp and tender chocolate chip cookies. For chewiest cookies, enjoy these warm from the oven. If you prefer them a bit crisp, wait until they've cooled before biting into one (or several). Store any remaining cookies at room temperature - a cookie jar keeps them handy!",
