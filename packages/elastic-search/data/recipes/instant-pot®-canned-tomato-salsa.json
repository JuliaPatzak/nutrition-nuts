    "summary": "Nothing beats fresh salsa in a blender when tomatoes are in season but when they are not, you've got to go with plan B. Out-of-season, pink, mealy tomatoes are just nasty so I choose canned tomatoes during those times. Canned requires cooking for me so I came up with an Instant Pot\u00ae recipe to simplify things.",
