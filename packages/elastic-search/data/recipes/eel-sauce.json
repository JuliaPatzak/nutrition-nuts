    "summary": "Also called Nitsume, Unagi or Kabayaki. It is a sweet and salty sauce that goes great over grilled fish or chicken and is a common drizzle over sushi. Traditionally it is used on Japanese grilled eel and eel rolls. I also use this sauce over fresh cooked noodles for a quick snack. 1/2 cup of dashi may be added to create a richer, more authentic flavor. (Dashi is a fish stock that must be made at home)",
