        "Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal",
        "Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and sprinkle with more flour",
        "Form the dough into a rectangle, and cut it into four equal parts",
        "Shape each piece into a ball, stretching and tucking the dough to create a smooth surface, adding more flour if needed",
        "Cover the dough balls with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes",
        "To shape the dough, sprinkle the surface with flour and lightly pat flat",
