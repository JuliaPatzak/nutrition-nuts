    "summary": "This recipe came from my momma and is my favorite fruit salad. It can also be made sugar-free for those who need to watch their blood sugar. Delicious either way. Also very easy to double this recipe too! You can vary the flavor of this salad by using some of the juices from either the mandarin oranges or the maraschino cherries, or both, in place of some of the pineapple juice. Enjoy!",
