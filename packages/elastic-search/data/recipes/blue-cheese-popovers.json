    "summary": "I'm very excited to show you this new, and possibly slightly improved, popover recipe. While we may have tweaked the ingredient amounts a little bit, we are still going to be using our foolproof, cold-oven method for making these. The reason this technique is so fun to use, is that it's literally the opposite of everything every popover expert says you should do.",
