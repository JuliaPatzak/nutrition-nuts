    "summary": "This is the best chicken slow cooker recipe ever, and I've tried a lot of them.  I can't remember where I originally got it from; my version has been tweaked a little.  I don't like mushrooms, but the mushrooms in the condensed soup are really big and easy to take out. Serve over hot cooked rice.",
