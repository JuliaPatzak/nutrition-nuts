    "summary": "If an Italian deli exploded inside a loaf of bread, it'd be this crispy meat- and cheese-stuffed braid made easy with just 5 ingredients, including pre-made pizza dough. Feel free to use homemade dough and/or turn this Italian party into a Spanish one using Serrano ham and Manchego cheese--or even a French one with Gruyere and Dijon!",

    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)",
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat",
        "Place pizza dough on a floured surface and roll into a rectangular shape between 1/8-inch and 1/4-inch thick, letting dough relax occasionally if it keeps springing back",
        "Spread pesto on top, leaving about a 1-inch border around the edge",
        "Top evenly with provolone cheese, prosciutto, and peppers",
        "Roll up tightly in the direction that gives you the most length, ending with the seam on the bottom",
        "Press down to flatten slightly and dust the top lightly with flour",
        "Use a pizza wheel to cut dough lengthwise into 3 long, even strips using a pizza wheel",
        "Place strips next to each other but not touching, the middle strip cut-side up and the other two cut-sides facing in",
        "Braid them together, then curl the ends in to form a round wreath shape, tucking any loose ends under the loaf",
        "Transfer onto the prepared baking sheet",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, about 30 minutes",
        "Let cool slightly and serve warm or at room temperature"
