    "summary": "This moist, not-too-sweet strawberry cake is covered with tart lemon icing and sprinkled with toasted slivered almonds.  I served it after dinner with fresh coffee, and it my friends went wild for it.  I like to use turbinado (raw) sugar because it is more flavorful and less processed than white sugar, but white sugar should work fine, too.",
