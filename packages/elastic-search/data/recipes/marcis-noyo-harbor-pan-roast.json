    "summary": "This summer in Fort Bragg, my husband went on a fishing charter and came back to the campground with a lot of fresh caught Cod.  We came up with this recipe, which was inspired by a pan roast dish we once had in a restaurant.  This dish is very versatile, delicious, and light! Serve with crunchy bread (whole wheat for extra fiber!), lemon wedges, or Tabasco sauce for an extra kick.",
