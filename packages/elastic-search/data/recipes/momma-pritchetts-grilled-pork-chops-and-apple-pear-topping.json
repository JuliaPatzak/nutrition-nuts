    "summary": "Well, I have yet to really eat good BBQ pork chops.  I was tired of the three or four different baking methods and I decided to try something a bit different.  If you are not into sweet, then this probably isn't the recipe for you.  I would suggest squeezing a bit of lime juice over the meat in order to break up the sweetness. I have never paid attention to what type of pork chops I had either, I just grabbed and baked...but apparently it is all in the cut of the meat! I also froze a few heads of romaine lettuce for about an hour, divided it up into 8 portions, and added Parmesan cheese and dressing of choice....  MMMM!",
