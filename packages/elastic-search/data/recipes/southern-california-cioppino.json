    "summary": "This popular dish originated around Monterey Bay, California.  This version, created in San Diego, has a southwest flavor. Serve with large bibs, crab shell crackers, extra bowls for the shells, and finger bowls if you wish.  Nice served in large, shallow bowls alongside crusty sourdough bread, a green salad, and chilled white wine.  You can vary the seafood according to the catch of the day, yours or your market's.",
