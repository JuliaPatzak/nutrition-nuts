    "summary": "These chicken mummies are perfect for a fun but healthy Halloween dinner to fuel your little ghouls and goblins for a long night of trick-or-treating. They are also a hit at adult Halloween parties. This recipe can be tailored quite easily: chicken tenders can be marinated in your choice of marinade before cooking; different flavored tortillas can also change the look and taste. Serve with your choice of condiments; salsa, guacamole, and sour cream go well, as do barbecue sauce or even ketchup.",
