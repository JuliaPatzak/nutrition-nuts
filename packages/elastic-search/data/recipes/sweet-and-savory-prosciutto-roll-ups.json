    "summary": "Impress your guests at your next wine and cheese night with these elegant prosciutto roll-ups. The combination of creamy goat cheese, sweet fig preserves, and savory prosciutto will make these disappear quickly! You'll want to double the recipe, or you can cut the rolls in half for a smaller serving size. I like to serve these over a bed of arugula that has been lightly tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper.",
