    "summary": "A friend was kind enough to show me this recipe some 15 years back, and I still use it frequently. It's not like the other cod curries on this site--it's lighter, and well worth a try. Especially when the vegetables are in season. Spice to your liking. Serve on top of basmati or white rice.",
