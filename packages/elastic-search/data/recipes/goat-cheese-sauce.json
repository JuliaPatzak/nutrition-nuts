    "summary": "I really wanted my husband to try goat cheese, so the other night I asked him if he wanted scalloped potatoes in a cheese sauce; he said 'yes,' and this is what I made. Afterwards he said I would definitely need to make this again, as he had four helpings. When I told him that it was goat cheese all he could say was 'REALLY?' and kept eating. I would say this was a winner; how about you? Just pour finished sauce over your choice of pasta, potatoes, or whatever you like.",
