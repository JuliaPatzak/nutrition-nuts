    "summary": "Lightly sweetened apples in a thick sauce cooked in a skillet without butter. These make a quick dessert that can be served alone or with vegan ice cream. They are even better the next day. I like to use them in crepes, on pancakes, or topped with a crumble and crisped up under the broiler.",
