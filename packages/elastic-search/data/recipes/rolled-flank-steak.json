        "Place the flank steak on a cutting board with the short end closest to you",
        "Starting from one of the long sides, cut through the meat horizontally to within 1/2 inch of the opposite edge",
        "(You can also ask your butcher to butterfly the flank steak for you instead of cutting it yourself",
        ") Mix the soy sauce, olive oil, and steak seasoning together in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag",

        "Arrange the bacon, spinach, red pepper, and mushrooms across the cheese covered steak in stripes running in the same direction as the grain of the meat",
