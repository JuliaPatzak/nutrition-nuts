    "summary": "This salad is a summertime pleaser. Every time I take it to a barbeque or gathering, everyone wants the recipe. Simple and quick to make with just a few ingredients. Everyone will love it! Can eat right away but the longer it sits in the refrigerator the better it tastes. I like to make it the day ahead of when I am wanting to serve. Enjoy!",
