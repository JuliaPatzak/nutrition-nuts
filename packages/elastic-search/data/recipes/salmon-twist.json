    "summary": "A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets. Adding vinegar or fish sauce and white pepper will emerge new flavors to create a Filipino or Thai twist! For more of a twist, use other types of fish, like cod, catfish or tilapia. You can even use it on chicken! Trust the cooking of the fillets and do not be tempted to open or you will lose valuable time and heat.",
