    "summary": "The secret ingredient to crispy carrot (or sweet potato fries) is a little bit of organic corn starch! Too much and they will be pasty, too little and they won't get as crispy. My favorite way to eat these is with a little ketchup mixed with sriracha (a 4:1 ratio.) You can just buy a pre-made Cajun seasoning at the store (easy), or make your own by combining the spices listed.",
