    "summary": "Grandma Amico made the best buttermilk sugar cookies. These cookies are soft and fluffy and a family tradition for us. Not just for the holidays, but whenever we get the urge for cookies, we make these. I will also leave dough in the fridge for up to a week and make cookies whenever I like. Dough freezes well for later cookie baking.",
