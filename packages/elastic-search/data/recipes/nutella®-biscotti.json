    "summary": "Subtly sweet from chocolate chips, Nutella\u00ae, and sugar, these twice-baked cookies get added crunch from toasted hazelnuts and melt to perfection in your mouth. They're easy to package and give as a gift to complement purchased coffee beans or a hot chocolate mix and can be served on a hot chocolate board spread during the holidays. Dunk in coffee, tea, or even milk!",
