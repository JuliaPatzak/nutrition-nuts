        "Mix beef, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl",
        "Divide beef mixture into three equal portions and shape into patties",
        "Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat",

        "Mix ketchup and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl; spread mixture over the crispy side of each ramen bun",
        "Divide arugula over 3 ramen buns",
        "Place burgers over arugula",
        "Heat about 1 teaspoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat; fry remaining eggs one at a time, adding more oil as needed, until yolk is almost firm, about 1 minutes per side",
