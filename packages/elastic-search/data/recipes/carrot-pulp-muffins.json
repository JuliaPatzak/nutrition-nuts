    "summary": "Looking at the mound of carrot pulp from my juicer and then at my 2-1/2-year-old daughter (who loves bread) inspired me to experiment... This muffin is dense, healthy, and can be tweaked to suit your tastes. As is, it is not sweet, but you could certainly add mashed ripe banana or pineapple. Once out of the oven, sprinkle the tops with cinnamon sugar while they are still hot.",
