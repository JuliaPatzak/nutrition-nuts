    "summary": "Lemon, ginger, and garlic infuse this salad with so much flavor, you don't miss the extra oil or cheese. Lima beans add some extra color, not to mention fiber and protein! I have substituted quinoa for the bulgur to great success (prepare according to package directions). Make sure to allow enough time to make ahead and let all the flavors marry in the fridge before serving.",
