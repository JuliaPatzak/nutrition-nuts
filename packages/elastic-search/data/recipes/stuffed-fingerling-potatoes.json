    "summary": "I had these at a catered party, and could not find a recipe anywhere to recreate them, so I made my own. These are the nicest little appetizers, and a nice change from the usual - plus the bonus of being able to make them early in the day. Leftover sour cream mixture can be used as a dip for potato chips.",
