    "summary": "Quinoa with various veggies and a zesty (and easy) vinaigrette that makes a wonderful salad dressing for any salad.  I used one English cucumber instead of 2 normal cucumbers because we prefer the taste. Cook the quinoa with the water as you would normal rice (works in a rice cooker as well).",
