    "summary": "When meatballs are gone, you can do shots of the sauce... Gotta admit, I usually cheat on the meatballs and buy 'em pre-cooked, or ya can make yer own. I make several batches of this and keep 'em in the freezer letting them ferment, although cuz of the alcohol content they don't freeze solid, LOL. All ingredients are to taste, no exact measuring is required... How much you make is optional. Be creative and have fun, do a shot.",
