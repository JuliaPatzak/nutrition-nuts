    "summary": "The best brownies are soft in the center and have a crust on the top, oh and they also have chocolate chunks and fresh raspberries in them too! This recipe couldn't be simpler-just measure everything into 1 bowl, mix, add raspberries and bake! No doubt these will be one of the best desserts you have EVER made! I use fresh raspberries out of my garden. I am sure you could use frozen, but perhaps you would need to drain off some of the liquid as to not screw with the proportions of the recipe. TRY not to eat the whole pan at once!",
