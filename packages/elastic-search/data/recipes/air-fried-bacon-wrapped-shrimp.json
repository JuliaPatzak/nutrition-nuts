    "summary": "Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients, but big on flavor! I like to use \"extra jumbo\" size shrimp, which are 16-20 per pound. Cutting the bacon lengthwise into narrow strips makes it easier to wrap. Refrigerating the shrimp, as well as using thin-cut bacon, will prevent the shrimp from overcooking in the time it takes to crisp the bacon.",
