    "summary": "This simple spread is reminiscent of a classic New Orleans muffuletta sandwich. This can be served on crackers, toasted bagels, or crostini. Also a nice addition to a pasta salad, a cheese board, or spooned on to grilled fish, pork or chicken. It will keep for up to a month in a tightly sealed container in the fridge.",
