    "summary": "Tired of the same old red pepper and butter 'hot sauce' on your wings? Try this on your next batch for a change of pace. We're crispy wing lovers, so we always make them fried. It might work for baked wings as well, but that hasn't been tested...yet. Make your fried wings according to your favorite recipe, coat the wings in this sauce, and sprinkle with sesame seeds just prior to serving. You should be able to coat about a dozen wing pieces with the recipe. Your wings are going to be sticky but the wing lovers I hang with claim they're well worth the mess.",
