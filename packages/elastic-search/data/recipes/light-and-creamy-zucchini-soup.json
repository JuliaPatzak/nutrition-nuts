    "summary": "Lots of zucchini this year, and I love soup. So what better than to make a zucchini soup? This is a light version, since I am watching my weight. If I were not, I would have used heavy cream and a lot more Romano cheese! Add or subtract any veggies you want. Corn and green beans would also be good. This comes out so creamy and rich tasting, you would never know how light in calories it is.",
