    "summary": "Poblano peppers are stuffed with ground meat and Spanish rice and baked in a tomato-based sauce with a sprinkling of cheese. American comfort food done up Latin-American style. We used boxed Spanish rice, but there are a number of good recipes on this site (Spanish Rice II and Best Spanish Rice) that I have used with good results. Serve with garnishments of choice - shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.",
