    "summary": "After years of tweaking my chocolate chip recipe, it is now ready for public consumption. It has been laboratory-tested on many of my friends all of whom seem to think its pretty great, as do I. They certainly aren't healthy, but its well worth the requisite post-cookie eating cardio workout. I hope it works for you as well as it has for me! Enjoy!",
