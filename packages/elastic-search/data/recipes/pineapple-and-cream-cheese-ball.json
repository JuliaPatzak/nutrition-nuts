    "summary": "This is a simple, fast, and easy holiday cheese ball recipe. It will remind you of your childhood if you are of a vintage age. If you loved the taste of Kraft\u00ae pineapple cheese spread on a Ritz\u00ae cracker this will really bring back comfort food memories. Makes a great potluck dish for parties. This is a big favorite at the holidays. I like to serve this with Chicken in a Biscuit\u00ae type of cracker, but your favorite crackers will do very nicely.",
