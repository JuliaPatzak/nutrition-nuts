    "summary": "Toss together a lively peach and cherry salsa, and serve on top of grilled chicken thighs. We wait all year for fresh stone fruit, so take advantage of the abundance and dish up a slightly different take on salsa. Grilling chicken thighs seems to be a bit more forgiving than white meat. The marinade for the chicken is tasty, too!",
