    "summary": "If your family doesn't care for the texture of regular oatmeal, then this is for you. It's more cake-like. This is the most requested recipe at the sports camp my kids went to. I modified the recipe to cut the fat and sugar and it is my kid's favorite breakfast. Make a pan on Monday and eat a quick, healthy breakfast the rest of the week.",
