    "summary": "Popovers are great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a snack, and this version is gluten free! They are easy to make and they appease even the pickiest of eaters. My favorite ingredient paired with dill is small-curd cottage cheese. It may not sound appetizing when you hear it... but believe me, it is good! I first learned about pairing these 2 ingredients in cooking school when we made cottage dill bread. I was hooked forever.",
