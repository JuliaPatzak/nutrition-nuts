    "summary": "Lightly breaded and fried shrimp are tossed in marinara sauce and baked with a cheese crust. Surprisingly, this does not taste oily at all. Very good flavor, nice and light. Serve over angel hair pasta with a tossed salad on the side. The red pepper sauce pairs well with the shrimp, but you can use your favorite marinara.",
