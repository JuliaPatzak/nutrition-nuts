    "summary": "If you like the flavor of oats, you will enjoy this.  Oat flour is just oatmeal ground into flour.  As a result the bread can be a little more chewy than others.  You can't use a lot of oat flour in a bread if you are using yeast.  Generally no more than 1/3 of the wheat flour can be substituted with oat flour.",
