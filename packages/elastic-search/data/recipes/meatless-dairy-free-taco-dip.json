    "summary": "I'm always looking for lactose-free dips because I'm lactose intolerant and, well, dips are my favorite. This one is healthy and just spicy enough, and actually tastes like a meaty taco dip with fatty refried beans. Top it off with some soy sour cream and fresh cilantro and dig in with some homemade tortillas.",
