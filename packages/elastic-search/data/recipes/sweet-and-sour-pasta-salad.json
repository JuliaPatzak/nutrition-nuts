    "summary": "This has been made by my family for years; not sure where it came from. Great for cookouts or picnics since there is no mayo. Best if made the day before to let flavors blend. Serve with your favorite chicken, pork, or beef as a refreshing side dish. You can substitute red, yellow, or orange peppers for the green to add extra color to this dish.",
