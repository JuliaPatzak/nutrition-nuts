    "summary": "My better half could not eat potatoes for a year (it's a long story), and used to make her own potato chips (crisps) from other sources, such as sweet potatoes and beets. The secret to this recipe is to slice the vegetables ultra thin. I use a mandolin or the slicing blade on my food processor. This makes a unique appetizer for a Super Bowl party!",
