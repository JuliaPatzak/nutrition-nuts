    "summary": "After searching the internet for a good Chinese Spareribs recipe and not finding any that caught my eye, I decided to make my own.  This recipe is pretty simple, and yields tender, juicy, tangy ribs.  In Japan, I cooked this in the fish broiler, but it should be fine on the grill or in the oven.",
