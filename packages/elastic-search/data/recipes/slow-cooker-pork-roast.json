    "summary": "I tried this cut of meat when it was on sale, and for lack of any other ideas I took suggestions from the back of the label, with a few tweaks (like making gravy). This is a very popular dish at our house, and it could not be easier! Instead of rubbing the roast with the onion soup mix and then adding the cranberry sauce, you can also just mix the onion soup mix with the cranberry sauce and pour the whole mixture over the roast.",
