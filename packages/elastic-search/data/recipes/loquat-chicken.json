    "summary": "If you have a loquat tree in your back yard or know someone who does, you'll be trying to find something to do with them. This is a great tart and spicy way to use some up of those seemingly endless loquats. Recipe would work well with pork too. Loquats are very much a seasonal fruit. Late spring to early summer is the only time of year you can find them. Pairs very well with rice.",
