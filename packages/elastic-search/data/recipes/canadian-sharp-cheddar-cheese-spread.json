    "summary": "Attention, cheese lovers! This may be the best cheese spread you've ever had! My friend's mother gave me this recipe over 15 years ago. I always make it around the holidays, or for football and hockey game nights. Everyone begs for this recipe. Turn this into a pub spread by adding a half cup of your favorite dark ale. Use brick cream cheese for a spread, or spreadable cream cheese for a dip. Serve with crispy crackers, toast, or bagels.",
