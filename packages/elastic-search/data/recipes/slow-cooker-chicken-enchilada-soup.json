    "summary": "Not quite a tortilla soup, not quite a taco soup, this comes together fast and gets better overnight. Stores like a dream and has fabulous flavor. Serve with sour cream and cheese on top, with either tortilla chips or cornbread on the side. Or if you're feeling fancy, you could make some paninis with pepper Jack cheese, roasted red peppers, avocados, tomatoes and mushrooms. Very tasty!",
