    "summary": "This golden sweet and mild salsa is a great solution for those heirloom yellow or orange tomatoes and combines well with peaches, which are being harvested at the same time. It is a favorite of the kids who are not always fond of typical salsas and shy from spicy foods. It also makes an excellent gift as a unique canned good.",
