    "summary": "This great summer recipe was given to me by a friend years ago. You can put any vegetables you want on the skewers. Don't be worried when you see the light corn syrup in the ingredients, it comes together great! It's a great change. You can even skip the vegetables and just skewer the chicken. Enjoy!",
