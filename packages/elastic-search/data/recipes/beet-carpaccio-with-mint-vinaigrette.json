    "summary": "A vegetarian alternative to beef carpaccio. This recipe wins over so many people who thought they hated beets or just never wanted to even try them. I was that person \u2013 once I actually tasted this recipe, well, I was sold and have loved beets ever since. Once beets are steamed and peeled, it is simple and easy. Beets can be prepped a day ahead and stored in a bag or container, but I personally like bringing it all together in one shot.",

    "ingredients": [
        "6  2-inch beets, trimmed, as evenly sized as possible",
        "2 ounces soft fresh goat cheese, or more to taste",
        "sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
        "\u2153 cup rice vinegar",
        "\u00bc cup chopped fresh mint",
        "\u00bc cup olive oil",
        "1 teaspoon white sugar"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Fill a pot with 3 inches of water, insert a steamer basket, and bring to a boil",
        "Reduce heat to medium or medium-low and place beets inside the steamer basket",
        "Cover pot",
        "Cook until beets are easily pierced with a knife, checking water level periodically, 35 to 50 minutes",
        "Remove from heat and cool, about 30 minutes",
        "Peel the beets; if you are using red and golden beets, peel the golden ones first so you don't end up turning them pink",
        "Remove any remaining root stems",
        "Thinly slice beets and arrange on a serving platter",
        "I use a round plate and start in the center, alternating red and golden beet slices",
        "Dot the top with goat cheese \u2013 you want to be able to see the beets but have enough cheese because it pairs so well with the beet",
        "Sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper",
        "Combine rice vinegar, olive oil, mint, and sugar in a small bowl",
        "Drizzle over beets"
