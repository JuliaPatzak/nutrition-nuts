    "summary": "I needed a quick and easy side dish to take to our friend's house for their son's birthday. This dish needed to be something that would be able to be outside and be pretty, so this is what I came up with. The variety of ingredients all tied together with the salad dressing was perfect, so much so that I took home an empty bowl!",
