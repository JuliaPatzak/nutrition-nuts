    "summary": "This is a good basic cream of chicken soup recipe. You can use cornstarch instead of flour to make the roux, if you are allergic to flour. You can also omit the salt, if you are on a restrictive diet. The best thing about making recipes yourself, is that you control what goes into your soup, minus the unhealthy preservatives!",
