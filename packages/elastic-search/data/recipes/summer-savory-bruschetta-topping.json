    "summary": "My own recipe, a summertime tradition with all home-grown ingredients. No onions, but uses a couple of herbs not found in a traditional bruschetta. Dicing the tomatoes is the time-consuming part. It is a major hit with friends and family! Serve on toasted Tuscan bread slices or crackers.",
