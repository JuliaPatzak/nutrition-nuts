    "summary": "This pound cake is a combination of some of my favorite flavors. It's predominately strawberry and lime, with a subtle, refreshing hint of mint that hits just on the back of your tongue. This cake is just as good without the mint, however--so if you're not a fan, feel free to omit it.",
