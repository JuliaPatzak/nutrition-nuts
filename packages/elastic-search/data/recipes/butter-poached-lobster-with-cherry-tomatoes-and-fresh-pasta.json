    "summary": "Butter-poaching lobster produces a beautiful, almost melt-in-the-mouth result. This dish combines the sweetness of butter-poached lobster with bright, acidic cherry tomatoes, a buttery sauce, and fresh, homemade pasta. The beurre monte in this recipe uses more water than usual, to produce a sauce that is less overwhelmingly rich when combined with the lobster.",
