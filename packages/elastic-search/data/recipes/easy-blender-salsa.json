    "summary": "My family begs me to make this during football season, with or without company coming over. It's so easy to make, that I don't mind. Use caution with the jalapeno pepper, however. I recommend using kitchen or disposable gloves. These amounts are the flavor my family likes, but you can use less or more jalapeno pepper depending on your tastes.",
