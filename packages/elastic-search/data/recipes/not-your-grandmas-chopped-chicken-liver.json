    "summary": "After working this recipe for years, it's finally ready to share. Suspect even those who don't enjoy liver might change their minds after tasting this on homemade crackers, toast, or bagels. I like it for light summer lunches or as an appetizer. The reduced bourbon/vermouth deglazing step adds an adult zing that rocks my world. Garnish with fresh herb sprigs or cucumber slices.",
