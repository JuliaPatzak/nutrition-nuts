        "4  baking potatoes, peeled and cubed",

        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",

        "Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes",
        "Drain and let cool",
        "Wash the pork stomach thoroughly in cold water",
        "Alternate stuffing the pork stomach with potatoes, sausage, and cabbage, seasoning with a little salt and pepper, until the stomach is full",
        "Try to make even layers, imagining how it will look when it is done and you slice it",
        "Fold closed, and place in a shallow roasting pan",
        "If you have any leftover stuffing ingredients, just place them in the pan around the outside",
        "Roast uncovered for 40 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until the sausage is cooked through and the stomach is browned and crispy",
        "When done, slice into 2 inch slices and serve piping hot",
        "You can make gravy out of the drippings if desired, but it is good by itself as a whole meal"
