    "summary": "Even people who normally do not touch asparagus (like myself and others I know), will find this an easy way to get those greens in. The oil will often settle to the bottom after chilled. You can either retoss before you serve, or leave it at the bottom and scoop around the puddle. Don't substitute white potatoes, they get mushier quicker and just don't have the same flavor.",
