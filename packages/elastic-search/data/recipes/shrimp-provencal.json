    "summary": "For a gourmet meal this is very easy to prepare.  Leftovers reheat well the next day too!  Instead of using fresh shrimp like the recipe originally called (took too long the first time I did it) we now use frozen, raw, peeled and it tastes the exact same, but with 1/4 of the time! This is great over rice and served with French bread.",
