    "summary": "I saw a recipe for baked radishes in a magazine long, long ago and the thought so intrigued me I just had to give it a try. This is my personalized version of the original. I often switch out the thyme with either rosemary, basil, or crushed garlic, depending on my mood and what main dish these will be served with.",
