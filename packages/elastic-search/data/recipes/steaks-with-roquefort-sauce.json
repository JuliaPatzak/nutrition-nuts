    "summary": "This recipe came to me when I was doing a Spanish themed party for a Hemingway book. Everyone LOVED the sauce so much I try to make it all the time. However, if you don't like bleu cheese, I wouldn't try it. I also substitute whiskey for the brandy, or any liquor that isn't sweet.",
