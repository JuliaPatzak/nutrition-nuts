    "summary": "\"Char siu\" literally means \"fork roast\" - \"char\" being \"fork\" (both noun and verb) and \"siu\" being \"roast\" - after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. This is best cooked over charcoal, but it's important to cook with indirect heat.",
