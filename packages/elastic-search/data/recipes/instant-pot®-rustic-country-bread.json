        "Stir bread flour, whole wheat flour, and salt together in a large bowl until well combined; set aside",
        "Gently whisk 1 1/4 cups warm water and yeast together in a small bowl",
        "Allow to rest at room temperature until foamy and fragrant, about 10 minutes",
        "Make a shallow well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in the yeast mixture",
        "Stir together using a spatula until a coarse dough begins to form",
        "Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and begin kneading, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes",
        "Shape dough into a ball and place in a large bowl lightly greased with cooking spray",
        "Cover the bowl with a towel lightly dampened with warm water and set aside in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours",
        "Lightly grease a 7- to 8-inch round cake pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper; lightly grease parchment paper with cooking spray; set aside",
        "Using your fingers, gently press down on dough to deflate slightly and transfer to a work surface that has been very lightly dusted with flour",
        "Gently knead dough 2 or 3 times, preserving as many air bubbles as possible",
        "Using the sides of your hands, shape dough into a ball by pulling the sides under until a smooth and slightly shiny surface develops",
        "Gently transfer dough to the prepared cake pan and lightly dust with flour; cover tightly with aluminum foil",
        "Add remaining 1 cup water and a steam rack to a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot\u00ae); place cake pan on the rack",
        "Close and lock the lid",
        "Turn vent to Sealing position",
        "Select Manual/Yogurt setting; set timer for 1 hour",
        "Dough will rise in cooker and double in size",
        "Press Cancel",
        "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)",
        "Select Manual/Pressure Cook setting on the Instant Pot\u00ae",
        "Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 40 minutes",
        "Allow 3 to 5 minutes for pressure to build",
        "Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 8 to 10 minutes",
        "Unlock and remove lid",
        "Carefully remove the cake pan as it will be hot; remove aluminum foil",
        "Transfer cake pan to the preheated oven and bake until bread is golden brown, about 20 minutes",
        "Remove bread from the cake pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing, about 30 minutes",
        "Using a bread knife, slice loaf crosswise into 3/4-inch thick slices"
