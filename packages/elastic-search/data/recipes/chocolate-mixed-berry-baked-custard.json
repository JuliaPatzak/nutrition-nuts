    "summary": "A lightly sweetened, chocolatey, baked dessert that's somewhere between a clafouti, a baked custard, and a Dutch baby. You can use any fresh or frozen berries you like (thaw and drain them first), and any kind of chocolate you wish (I've used both 72% and 86% dark chocolate with great results). This can be served immediately out of the oven, or cooled completely.",
