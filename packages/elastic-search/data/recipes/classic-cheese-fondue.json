    "summary": "Want to make fondue like a Swiss guru? Try this easy, simple, and foolproof method for making the ultimate cheese lover's dish! The combination of acidic wine with the rich, buttery cheeses is a wonder to behold. Besides the amazing taste and texture, there's just something fun about eating things off the end of a really long fork! Half the fun of this is customizing the platter of \"dippables\" to your taste, such as cubes of crusty bread, sausage, baby potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, fennel, apples, or grapes.",
