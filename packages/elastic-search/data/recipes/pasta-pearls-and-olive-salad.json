    "summary": "Acini di pepe is a small, round, pasta perfect for soups and salads. This salad can be served hot, cold, or my favorite, room temperature. Try some different combinations of additions to make variations, such as roasted broccoli with toasted almonds; sun-dried tomatoes, wilted arugula, olives, and feta cheese; spinach; or scallions and feta cheese.Israeli couscous or orzo can be substituted for the acini de pepe.",
