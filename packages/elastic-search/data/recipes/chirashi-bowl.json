    "summary": "Home-style Japanese cooking. It is basically all of the ingredients for sushi mixed up in a bowl and served. It is a very fast and convenient way to enjoy the taste of sushi without all the work! I like to have cut-up pieces of seaweed to serve on the side, and a soy sauce-wasabi mixture is nice too. Good with tea, but better with beer.",
