    "summary": "My own version of the Italian dessert favorite. 'Panna Cotta' literally means 'cooked cream.' I made it for my husband to take to a work function and they loved it!  They send him home with a request for it every year now! I created the simple strawberry sauce to accompany it.  It really makes the dish!",
