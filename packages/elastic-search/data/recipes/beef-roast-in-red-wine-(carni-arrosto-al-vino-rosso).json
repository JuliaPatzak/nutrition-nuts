    "summary": "A slow cooker recipe that turns the most economical roast of beef into a tender, succulent, delicious meal. The wine really enhances the flavor of the meat, and non-alcoholic wine can also be used to great success for those who prefer it. Coming home to the aroma of this slow-cooked beef will put you in mind of stepping into a nice Italian restaurant. Very comforting and inviting. Serve over rice or egg noodles.",
