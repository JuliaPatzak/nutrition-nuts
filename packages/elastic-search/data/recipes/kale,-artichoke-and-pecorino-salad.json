    "summary": "I created this kale, artichoke, and pecorino salad the other day with ingredients I had in the house as a side dish for company. Everyone just loved this dish! Adding the pecorino right before serving gave the salad and extra flavor that made this dish very yummy! Give it a try! You can omit the cheese to keep it paleo!",
