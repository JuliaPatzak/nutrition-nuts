    "summary": "This is one of my favorite Cuban foods. It reminds me of the countryside. I like this with black bean soup and rice and either platanos maduros (fried ripe plantains) or tostones (fried pressed plantains). You could also serve with black beans and rice cooked together. A spicy Cabernet Sauvignon would go well with this dish.",
