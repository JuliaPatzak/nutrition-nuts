    "summary": "Delicious and filling snacks my friend Danielle told me about. I cannot get enough of these! Nothing processed and jam-packed with nutrition. I took these on a 5-hour flight and they kept me satisfied. Also my mom is on a no-processed-food cancer diet and these are a life-saver for the days she doesn't feel well enough to juice and cook! Store bites in the refrigerator or freezer.",
