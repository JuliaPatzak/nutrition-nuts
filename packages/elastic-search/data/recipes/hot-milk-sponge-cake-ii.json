    "category": "desserts",
    "author": "MC",
    "summary": "This cake can be made in under 15 minutes, but be sure to follow the directions carefully. To ensure proper volume, the hot milk must be beaten rapidly into the batter, and the flour added immediately. When correctly made, the cake should rise to the top of the pan. This is also the perfect foundation for two American classics, Boston Cream Pie and Washington Pie.",
