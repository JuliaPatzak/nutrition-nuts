    "summary": "I live in a peanut-free building, but sometimes I just need a peanut butter cookie. I was wracking my brain as to how to get this taste one day, and I came up with these. They more than fit the bill and I think that instead of craving peanut butter cookies, I'll be craving these from now on instead. The cookie vultures will wait around your cooling racks in droves - I know I had a couple! Total crowd pleaser and totally peanut free!",
