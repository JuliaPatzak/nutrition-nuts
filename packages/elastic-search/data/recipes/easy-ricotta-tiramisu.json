    "summary": "This recipe does not require the traditional marscapone cheese, which can be both expensive and difficult to find.  Actual preparation time is short, but as it must 'age' for at least 10 to 12 hours, this is a dessert best prepared a day ahead of time. Dust with unsweetened cocoa powder.",
