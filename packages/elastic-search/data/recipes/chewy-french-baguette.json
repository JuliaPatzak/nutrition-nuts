    "summary": "I don't bake with bread flour or rapid yeast, and I don't have a bread machine. This is a pretty good loaf using things I already have. One might call it 'French on a budget' bread. This recipe can make 1 big loaf or 6 sandwich rolls. I find they're best served warm with homemade butter.",
