    "summary": "I wanted to create something light with relatively few ingredients that didn't have vying tastes. This was perfect. Very simple but delicious. The measurements for the broth and balsamic vinegar are approximate. I served it with thin no-yolk egg noodles with a little bit of browned butter, black pepper, and chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Great side.",
