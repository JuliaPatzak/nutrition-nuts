    "summary": "Typical of Baden-Baden and the Baden-Wurttemberg state in southwestern Germany,  schupfnudeln is a kind of spaeztle (homemade pasta) that gets its name from the Upper German word 'Schupfen,' meaning 'to shove, push, throw or chuck.' They are traditionally handmade by rolling out potato dough on a board and cutting the dough into noodles. Simple and easy to make, they are delicious and go well with almost anything: roast pork, racks of lamb, bits of bacon, sauerkraut, and any cabbage dishes.",
