    "summary": "We go deep-sea fishing each spring when the kids get out of school for spring break. I only have a couple of ways to cook amberjack aside from frying (which we do not eat a lot of).  This recipe has minimal ingredients and is super easy. You can season some pieces more heavily than others depending on everyone's taste.",
