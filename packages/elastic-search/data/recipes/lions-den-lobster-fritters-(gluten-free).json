    "summary": "Lobster, melted garlic butter, and shredded unsweetened coconut are this recipe's tasty ingredients. Our home in the Bahamas is called the Lion's Den and that is where this recipe was born. Hubby & I live on a small out-island in the Bahamas and it can be difficult to get gluten free items unless I bring them from the States. I have learned to make the things that I crave out of the ingredients I have on hand. Serve with your favorite dipping sauces or ketchup.",
