    "summary": "This is a delightfully fresh salsa with a slight kick, that is super tasty with jerk chicken, grilled seafood, quesadillas or warm corn chips (especially blue ones - the colors are fabulous together!). Plus, it is super easy to make! This salsa is fairly mild, although the onion does pack some punch. I like it this way as a contrast to more spicy Mexican or Caribbean dishes, and because it really allows the yummy fruit flavors to shine!! However, you can add some fresh jalapeno or other pepper if you want it more spicy.",
