    "summary": "Use this toward the end of cooking as you would for any BBQ meat such as pork, ribs, or chicken. I have even used it on beef and hamburgers, sausages, hot dogs, or anything you want, for the most part.  I use it on everything from ribs to roasts to hamburgers to hot dogs. Even goes good with a good old classic grilled cheese sandwich. This is a great all-round BBQ sauce. Use right away or cool to room temperature, transfer to jars or containers, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months in the fridge.",
