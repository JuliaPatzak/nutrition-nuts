    "summary": "This is not for the weak stomach; this spicy slaw is a nice addition when you want to add a side dish with an Asian flair.  Refrigerate salad for at least an hour, but 24 is better to allow flavors to set. Serve by itself or on an Asian salad. Also makes a good spring roll filling.",
