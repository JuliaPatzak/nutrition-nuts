    "summary": "A more simple version of an already wonderful recipe. Sweet and spicy blended together for a fast and tasty snack! I recommend serving this with a red chili Asian dipping sauce. Yum! Also note that if you want a less spicy version, feel free to seed your jalapeno, choose to omit the jalapeno or curry powder, or both.",
