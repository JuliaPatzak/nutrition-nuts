    "summary": "I call this diet haters' diet food because simple substitutions mean you won't feel deprived.  You shouldn't miss the tortilla chips because you have delicious black beans instead, and you still get the yummy spicy Mexican flavor and cheese. While not necessarily authentic, this salad is easy to make!  If you have time, it's is also wonderful topped with onions and maybe fresh jalapenos.",
