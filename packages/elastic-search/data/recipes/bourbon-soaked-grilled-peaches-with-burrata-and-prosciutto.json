    "summary": "I hope I had you at bourbon-soaked peaches. Sometimes ingredients come together so perfectly all you need to do is assemble and enjoy. These juicy, ripe peaches soaked in bourbon, combined with rich, salty prosciutto, creamy Burrata, and peppery arugula hit all the right flavor notes making this the most amazing harmonious dish I've had in a long time. Plus grilling fruit deepens its flavor which enhances everything. I'm not kidding about this one. Time to hit the patio and put this dish on heavy summer rotation.",
