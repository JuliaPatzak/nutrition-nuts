    "summary": "So far this is the best I've come up with for waffles. They get a nice crispy outer shell in my waffle iron that I find delicious. Be warned: you have to like buckwheat to like these. Using half creamer and half milk is pretty awesome if you don't mind the extra fat/calories. You can substitute applesauce for the oil, if desired.",
