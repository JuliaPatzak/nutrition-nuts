    "summary": "Fish fry seasoning, egg, and a spritz of oil are all you need to make these tasty, crispy air fryer shrimp! Use your favorite brand of fish fry breading mix. Serve with cocktail sauce, lemon-garlic aioli, or whatever you prefer! I like to use a Misto\u00ae sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray.",
