    "summary": "This festive Mardi Gras mashup is perfect for anyone seeking a lower-effort alternative to homemade king cake. The key to keeping this recipe big and easy is store-bought puff pastry--which encases a gooey cinnamon-sugar filling, and is frosted with a decadent cream cheese glaze. So while it's certainly not a traditional king cake, this giant brown sugar-cinnamon tart does offer a similarly flaky, buttery, and sweetly delicious pastry experience. In place of the plastic baby typically that's hidden in a king cake after it's finished baking, you can always tuck an almond or other nut.",
