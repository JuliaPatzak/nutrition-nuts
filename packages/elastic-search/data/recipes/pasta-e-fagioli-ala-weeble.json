    "summary": "As a Canadian, growing up in Toronto's Little Italy, this soup was always on someone's stovetop somewhere in the fall and winter months. Pasta, beans, and a thick broth, sprinkled with Parm or Romano, and served with fresh crusty Italian bread - what's not to love? I spent a lot of time, back in the day, in the cucina with my friends and their mothers learning the basics of good Italian food!",
