    "summary": "I threw together this pasta with what I had, as an attempt to make a creamy sauce sans heavy cream. It's more of an olive oil-cheese sauce than a pesto sauce, and it clings best to angel hair. The key is cooking the pasta with shrimp shells. Oh, and not to overcook anything, by having all the ingredients ready to go. The sweetness of the shrimp and red bell pepper complements the savory capers and sun-dried tomatoes.",
