    "summary": "Traditionally, summer sausage is made and cured in the winter so that it's ready to enjoy during the summer, but unless you have some sort of time machine, we're going to have to settle on this easy, and much faster, shortcut method. Despite only taking a few days, this comes really close to everybody's favorite gift-basket sausage and makes a great centerpiece to any charcuterie board.",
