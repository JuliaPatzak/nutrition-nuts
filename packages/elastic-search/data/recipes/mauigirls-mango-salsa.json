    "summary": "This recipe is a staple in our Maui home. It disappears so fast, you may want to double it. I have made this with pineapple, papaya, and mango. It is very good with a little bit of finely chopped star fruit added if you have one around. Depending on ripeness of fruit and heat of pepper, I adjust to my personal preference.",
