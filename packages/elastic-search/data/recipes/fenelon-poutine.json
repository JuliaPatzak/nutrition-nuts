    "summary": "Courtesy of us old-time students from Fenelon Falls - this is how I ate poutine almost every day in my high school days (oh, the memories!). People say real poutine must have mozzarella cheese curds - I emphatically disagree! In every restaurant I've been to in Ontario, they use shredded cheese. If you're like me and prefer the English-Canadian version (non-cheese curds) and want to try something different, try this!",
