    "summary": "This is a recipe I created using the idea that pork and apples go splendidly together! The seasonings give the pork a sweet and slightly spicy taste. The apple cider adds to the sweetness, while bringing a unique tartness as it is absorbed into the meat. Serve with applesauce, if desired. Hope you enjoy!",
