    "summary": "This is an awesome spin on a plain grilled cheese sandwich. Feel free to alter it to  your liking. The ciabatta bread is not typical grilled cheese material but the crunch of the buttery grilled chewy bread goes perfect with this jalapeno filling. You can also use sourdough bread.",
