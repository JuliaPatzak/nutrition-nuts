    "summary": "Great for kids and grown-ups alike as a main dish, I made this last Halloween inspired by something I found on the web and I've had a lot of requests for it. You can make the eyeballs earlier in the day and keep in fridge. Pull eyeballs out when you are ready to cook your pasta so that they are at room temperature for serving. Place eyeballs on top of your favorite spaghetti and red sauce. Can also be served as finger-food appetizers at your Halloween party.",
