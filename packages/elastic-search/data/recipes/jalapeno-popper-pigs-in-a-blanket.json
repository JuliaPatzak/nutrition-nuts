    "summary": "This blends the best of two worlds. Jalapeno poppers and pigs in a blanket. They aren't the traditional small size appetizers, so they're perfect for a satisfying snack. These get double jalapeno flavor with jalapeno-smoked sausage. If you want an even fancier presentation, use puff pastry.",
