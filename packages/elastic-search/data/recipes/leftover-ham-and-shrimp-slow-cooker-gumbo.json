    "summary": "Great for finishing off that holiday ham that just won't quit! Also able to freeze and save for later if hammed out. Two of my 3 young sons loved it. The third asked for no beans and shrimp which was easy to filter out in his bowl.  Husband devoured it and wished it had more shrimp. Overall a success considering it was a week out from daily doses of Easter ham. Serve by itself or over white rice.",
