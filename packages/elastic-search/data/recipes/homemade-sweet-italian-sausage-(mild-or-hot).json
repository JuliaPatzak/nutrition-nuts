    "summary": "This is a very versatile Italian sausage which can be used in many different ways. You can take it from mild to hot and it's very easy to use. There are also different options for type of meat to use, like ground chuck or ground turkey (do not use ground beef). If using ground turkey, you'll have to coat your skillet with a little olive or veggie oil before cooking as it has very little fat and will stick to skillet.",
