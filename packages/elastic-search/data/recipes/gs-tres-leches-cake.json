    "summary": "A dense yet light dessert better served cold and a day or two old. Room temperature + (over 80 degrees F) is a must for making this cake! You really have to plan this one for something special as far as I'm concerned. It's sooo much better put together and let set for a day or two in the fridge, covered.",
