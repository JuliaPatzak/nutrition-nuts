    "summary": "Andrew came home for the holidays on a very quick trip. While gathering around the kitchen snack bar munching he said, 'Hey, wanna try one of my recipes?' He proceeded to throw this dish together while we all visited and watched. What a great surprise when it was finished. He made it again the next night and again, it was gone in minutes. A very colorful and tasty treat enjoyed by all! Serve with tortilla chips.",
