    "summary": "A real-deal beef slider isn't just a tiny hamburger, which is what you get at the vast majority of restaurants. To be authentic, it has to be steamed over a bed of onions, bread, and all. You can change up the toppings, but I love them best with the traditional pickles and onions.",
