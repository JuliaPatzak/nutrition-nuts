    "summary": "Legend has it that the Sloppy Joe was first created in Sioux City, Iowa in 1930 by a cook named Joe. We think Joe would love this creamy, cheesy, game day dip! Season ground beef with McCormick\u00ae Sloppy Joes Seasoning Mix for authentic flavor. Add cream cheese, tomato sauce, onions, and Cheddar Jack cheese to beef. Bake until ooey-gooey and garnish with dill pickle slices. Tangy, sweet and savory, it's best enjoyed loaded on top of potato chips.",
