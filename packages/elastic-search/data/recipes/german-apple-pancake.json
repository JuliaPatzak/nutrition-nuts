    "summary": "Also known as a Dutch baby, this is a terrific 'special day' recipe.  If you are strapped for time, you can start it the evening before and pretty much pop it in the oven. The presentation is excellent! You can shorten the preparation time by using apple pie filling, but the crisp of new apples really makes it.",
