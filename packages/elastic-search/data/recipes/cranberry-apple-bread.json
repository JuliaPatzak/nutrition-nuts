    "summary": "This bread is a holiday favorite in our family. It's very festive and is a wonderful breakfast bread for Thanksgiving and Christmas morning. I like to prepare my bread batter ahead of time and thaw it out the night before I serve it. Just pop it in the oven in the morning and you have fresh breakfast bread. Enjoy!",
