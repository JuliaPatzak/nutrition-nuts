    "summary": "A vatrushka is a Russian open-faced pie or tart. Made with various doughs and pastries and dozens of fillings, vatrushki are a traditional tea-time treat. The most popular type is a yeast bun topped with sweet cottage cheese filling. This is a summer version, filled with fragrant fresh raspberries. The dough rises three times, a lengthy but time-proven method for a unique smoothness.",
