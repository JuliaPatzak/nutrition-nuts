    "summary": "A yummy twist on normal buttered popcorn that is quick to make and oh so good! Almond bark is slightly sweeter than white chocolate and just melts in your mouth. You can make this recipe festive for any holiday by adding any color sprinkles while popcorn is still warm. Wait until it is completely cooled before breaking it up and storing it.",
