    "summary": "A Korean dish, popular in northern China. I ate this for lunch every day for an entire year when I lived in Jinzhou, China. The cook was certain that eating this cold dish during the cold northern winter would be bad for my stomach, but it never was! This makes a wonderfully refreshing lunch during the hot summertime.",
