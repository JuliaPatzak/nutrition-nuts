    "summary": "This soup is so versatile that it works with whatever you have on hand. If you don't love chickpeas, use cannellini, black or kidney beans. Or, take them out\u00a0altogether.\u00a0If you don't like kale add swiss chard or spinach. Feel free to switch up the spices if you prefer something a bit tamer.",
