    "summary": "My Samoyed, as he grew out of puppyhood, refused to eat kibble (and even canned food) and would go days without eating or eating very little until he lost weight. Frustrated, I did some research and started giving him this homemade dog food twice a day. He is back to a normal weight, and is very happy! Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Serve without bones; give separately as a treat as desired and use caution.",
