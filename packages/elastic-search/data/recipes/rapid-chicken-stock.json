    "summary": "This simple yet flavorful chicken stock is great for everything...and the pressure cooker is the magic tool here! You need a decent-sized pressure cooker for this recipe. The result is the same thing you'd get with 8+ hours of conventional simmering. This is a great way to use a leftover chicken carcass from dinner the night before, even if it's one of those rotisserie chickens from the store! I like to season the stock at the end, so that you can accurately control the amount of salt.",
