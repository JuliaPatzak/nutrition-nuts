    "summary": "Creamy, flavorful risotto with easy-to-follow directions. Don't be intimidated:  just get your broth going in one pan, and your rice in another, and slowly combine. Don't forget to taste as you get toward the end of cooking! This seafood recipe uses clams and leftover salmon, but the seafood variations are endless. I use water and clam juice here (not chicken broth) to allow the seafood flavor to shine.",
