    "summary": "Seafood sausage is a great, underrated way to take less than thrilling seafood, like some sleepy sole, and previously frozen salmon, and make something that seems far more special. The flavor is lovely, and the texture is similar to a boudin blanc, or white hot dog, if you prefer. You can brown and serve these right after they're done boiling, but I like to make them ahead of time.",
