        "Measure flour, cardamom, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer",
        "Pour in wet ingredients and attach dough hook",
        "Mix until dough comes together in a shaggy mass",
        "Cover the stand mixer with a clean dish towel and let dough rest for 10 minutes",
        "Uncover the dough and knead on medium speed until smooth, about 5 minutes",
        "Continue to knead on low speed until dough is soft, elastic, and shiny, about 5 minutes more",
        "Transfer to an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap",
        "Place in a warm spot until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours",
        "Meanwhile, make the blueberry filling",

        "Chill until completely cool",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface",
        "Punch down and divide into 2 pieces",
        "Roll 1 piece into a 9x18-inch rectangle, squaring off with a bench scraper as you roll to make it is as even as possible",
        "Spread 1/2 of the blueberry filling over the dough, leaving about a 1-inch border",
        "Roll up the dough into a tight roll, starting from the long edge closest to you",
        "Pinch seams to seal",
        "Repeat with the remaining dough and filling",
        "Place logs side by side on a lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for 1 hour",
        "Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to each log in half, lengthwise, so you have 4 filled strips of dough on the baking sheet",
        "Place 2 strips across each other to form a plus sign",
        "Arrange the remaining 2 strips to form an interlocking cross",
        "Fold the end of the strip closest to you over the strip to its right",
        "Repeat 3 more times, moving clockwise",
        "Fold remaining strips over to the left, moving counterclockwise",
        "Repeat folding step until only short ends remain; join ends and tuck them carefully under the braid",
        "Cover the braid and place in a warm place to rise for 45 minutes",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) towards the end of the second rise",
        "Beat egg with a pinch of salt and brush some over the braid",
        "Sprinkle with pearl sugar",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes",
