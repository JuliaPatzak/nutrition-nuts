    "summary": "This lemon zucchini bread has wowed every person my Mom made it for, and she has now passed this tried-and-true recipe to me, with the same results. If you are tempted to skip the nutmeg, don't! It's the secret ingredient that makes this bread pop. This loaf won't last a day in your house, so it's best to double or triple the recipe to ensure everyone gets a slice! The loaf freezes well, just slice before freezing.",
