    "summary": "My dad would stop at our local store's deli each holiday just to purchase the dried beef cheese ball he loved. One year after tasting a similar style, I decided to mix the two together and came up with this dip. It is in honor of my dad who 'had to have' his cheese ball every year! This version is now a staple at all our family gatherings! Serve with crackers or bagel chips. You can use low-fat or fat-free versions of the cream cheese, sour cream, and cheddar cheese to lower calories and fat.  I would not recommend fat-free cheddar cheese though.",
