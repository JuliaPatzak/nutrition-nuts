    "summary": "I was looking to make some warm comfort food on a cold winter day. I was thinking chicken pot pie but wanted to try something different, though along the same lines - served in a individual baking dish with a creamy sauce, and topped with puff pastry. Sounds like chicken pot pie but I wanted salmon! I looked at some fish pie recipes but nothing I found came in that familiar comforting form. So I set out on my own and this is what I came up with! Hope you enjoy it.",
