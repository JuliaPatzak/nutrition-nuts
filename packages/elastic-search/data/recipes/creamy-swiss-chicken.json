    "summary": "Chicken breasts topped with Swiss cheese and baked in a creamy white wine sauce. I made this dinner for my senior prom date almost 20 years ago. She is but a distant memory, while this chicken dish is a HIT when I have the men over for dinner parties! If desired, serve with mixed greens tossed with pecans, a fruit vinaigrette and crumbled blue cheese. Add herbed egg noodles and a crusty bread, and you've got a meal made in heaven!",
