    "summary": "A quick and easy recipe for delicious pickled peppers! My husband loves these, and the amount of garlic can be adjusted depending on personal taste. We use a lot because we're big fans of pickled garlic too. You could also substitute serrano peppers for the jalapenos, cauliflower for the carrots, or add small onions. Pickles will keep approximately 6 weeks in the fridge.",
