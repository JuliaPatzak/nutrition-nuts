    "summary": "I cheat and use prepackaged angel food cake, but I absolutely, always, use fresh fruit and make the whipped cheesecake cream myself. I use a cream cheese whipped cream so that I stays looking nice when it has to sit around on a buffet for a few hours. Since the cream cheese gives it stability you can use WAY less sugar than traditional whipped cream calls for.",
