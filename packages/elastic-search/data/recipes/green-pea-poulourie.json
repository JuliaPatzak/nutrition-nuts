    "summary": "These vegetarian balls can be served as a main dish or appetizer.  As a main dish, serve with white or brown rice.  As an appetizer, they are delicious dipped in tomato-ey sauce of any kind (ketchup, barbeque, salsa).  In the rare event that there are leftovers, the balls take on a great texture when reheated in marinara sauce and are good served with pasta.",
