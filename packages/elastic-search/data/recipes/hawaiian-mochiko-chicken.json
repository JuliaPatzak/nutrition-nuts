    "summary": "This mochiko chicken is my daughter's favorite thing in the whole wide world. If you have never eaten mochiko chicken then you don't know what you been missing. This is a staple in many potlucks, tailgating and family gatherings. Mochiko is a Japanese sweet flour that makes a light batter. I make this for my family of 8 once a month. I have to triple the recipe and there is never leftovers.",
