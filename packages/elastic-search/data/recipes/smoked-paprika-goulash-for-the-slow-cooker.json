    "directions": [
        "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat",

        "Add the garlic and cook for one minute",

        "Put a third of the beef cubes into the skillet and cook until nicely browned on all sides",
        "Transfer to the slow cooker",

        "Stir the tomato paste and the rest of the water into the slow cooker; cover",

        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat",

        "Drain",
        "Serve goulash over noodles with a dollop of sour cream and a sprig of parsley"
