    "summary": "The 'magic' of this recipe is a truly fluffy bread-like dough that works great for buns and dinner rolls. Gluten-free, nut-free, low carb, Atkins\u00ae, keto, and diabetic-friendly. This dough is amazing! It's light, fluffy, moist, and tastes very close to traditional bread. The mix makes 6 burger, sandwich, or hot dog buns, or 12 dinner rolls.",
