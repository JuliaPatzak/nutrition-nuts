    "summary": "Brie's nutty flavor and creamy texture is perfectly complemented by this simple yet sumptuous warm dip. I served this at a Christmas party and even the non-Brie-lovers enjoyed it. The flavor of Brie is more subtle than usual because of the other ingredients, but it still is enjoyable for Brie fans.",
