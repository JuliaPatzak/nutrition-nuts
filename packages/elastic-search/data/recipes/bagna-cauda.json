    "summary": "Ever since a family friend introduced us to this Italian dip, we have made it a tradition on New Year's Eve. You have to really like garlic to enjoy this. I have heard that some people omit the cream and substitute olive oil also. Serve with crusty Italian bread, raw cabbage wedges, lettuce, bread sticks or crackers.",
