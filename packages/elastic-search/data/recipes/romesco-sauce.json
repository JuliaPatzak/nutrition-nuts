    "summary": "A wonderful versatile Latin sauce originating in Spain with amazing flavors. It can be served with grilled chicken, fish and seafood, as a sauce for pasta, or alone as a dip. Once you try this, you will be hooked! Try using hazelnuts instead of the almonds. Can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 week. Tastes are enhanced if allowed to sit for a few hours.",
