    "summary": "Taking the traditional s'more and giving it a Halloween twist! Perfect if you don't have a fire pit for roasting and great for a crowd. The only 'cooking' involved is melting the chocolate. If you don't want to take the time to melt the chocolate, they sell chocolate icing in piping bags already for cakes and cookies. You can buy those for easy use, especially if this is for kids.",
