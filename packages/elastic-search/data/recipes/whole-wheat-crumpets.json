    "summary": "These are a little like an English muffin, except a bit more dense and cake-like with a hint of sweetness. They are good eaten warm and soft, or you can let them sit out a bit for a more European crusty texture, then slice and toast them. Serve in the manner of biscuits or English muffins. Good for sandwiches, too! Especially good is an egg sandwich made with these.",
