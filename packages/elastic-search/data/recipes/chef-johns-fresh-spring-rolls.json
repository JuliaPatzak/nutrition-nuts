    "summary": "I love the 'authentic' spring rolls I so often order at my friendly, neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant.\u00a0But in this recipe, I'm showing a technique and you can fill the rolls with whatever you have on hand. You should be able to get rice paper wrappers at any large grocery store with an Asian food section but if not, they're easily found online.",
