    "summary": "Very easy and tasty recipe I invented one day with ingredients on hand, for fresh rainbow trout (farmed or wild) that my family loves. It takes very little time and is much lighter than ocean fish. I use whole fish you can buy already  gutted from the supermarket, with heads and tails still on. Make sure you pick trout that are really, really fresh. I find the dish doesn't even need lemon slices but you can use them if you like. The key is to remember to add the water to the dish as instructed in directions, which keeps fish from drying out. Serve with rice and veggies. Light and delicious. Be careful of bones! Make sure to add hot water to the dish; cold water can crack the baking dish.",
