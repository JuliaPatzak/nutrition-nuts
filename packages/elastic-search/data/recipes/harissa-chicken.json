    "summary": "If you are interested in a little bit of heat, but not too much, this is a great recipe for you. I used a mortar and pestle to form the spice paste, but you can easily use a small bowl and the back side of a spoon. Be sure to pair it with sides that counteract the heat. I served this alongside rice with peas and onions mixed in. It was perfect! The salad that I served the chicken on top of, Green Chile and Tomato Salad, is also another recipe of mine on this site. Check it out!",
