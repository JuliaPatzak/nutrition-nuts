    "summary": "Fried wontons filled with a mixture of whatever you have on hand are a good place to start. I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone loved them! No special deep fryer is needed, your standard 10 inch frying pan will work. You can dip them in your favorite salsa or salsa and sour cream mixture for a lighter dipping sauce.",
