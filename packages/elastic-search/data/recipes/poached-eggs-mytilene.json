    "summary": "I learned this no-fail poached egg recipe from a Greek chef I worked with who grew up in Mytilene. He ate this for breakfast just about every morning and it reminds him of his mother to this day. I make it for breakfast pretty frequently and it always gives me a good start to my day. I recommend it for you and your family. It can be served with potatoes, toast, milk, juice, etc. to complete a good breakfast.",
