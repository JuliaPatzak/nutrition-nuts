    "summary": "Based on the Cottage Pudding Upside-Down Cake on this site, this plummified version ensures the same fluffy base but with specks of cinnamon thrown in for visual effect. Use a mix of sweet and sour plums for best results and adjust the brown sugar amounts if most of them are sour. Note that flipping the cake will be messier if your plums are overripe. Once it's cooled down, you'll want to reheat it for about 10 seconds in the microwave for the tastiest results.",
