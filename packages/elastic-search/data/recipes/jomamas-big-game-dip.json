    "summary": "This dip has never gotten bad reviews. In fact I use it to make a good first impression at most parties. It takes the normal sour cream and salsa dip and kicks it into an awesome dip for all to overeat. This dip for some reason is A LOT better when served with thin wheat crackers rather than tortilla chips or any other option.",
