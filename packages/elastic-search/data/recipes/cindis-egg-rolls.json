    "summary": "These are the best-tasting egg rolls you'll ever have. They're even better than the ones served at Asian restaurants. My family just loves them. What's even better is that you can use a variety of different meats--ground beef, pork steak, seasoned ground pork sausage, precooked shrimp--or prepare them without meat for the vegetarians.",
