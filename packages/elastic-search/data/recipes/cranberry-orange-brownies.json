    "summary": "This is the perfect fall brownie! I absolutely love how these come out. The orange blossom water adds a delicate sweetness to the fudgy chocolate, while the cranberries give a surprising tangy flavor. The only problem is these brownies do not last very long--they'll be gone the second you put them on the table!",
