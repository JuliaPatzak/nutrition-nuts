    "summary": "A thick, spicy sauce of garlic, olive oil, and fire-roasted tomatoes is sauteed with shrimp or your favorite seafood. Legend has it that it was named for Michele Pezza, also known as 'Fra Diablo' (Friar Devil), who helped push Napoleon's forces out of Naples. Serve the sauce over hot pasta, or, my favorite, hot couscous cooked with olive oil and garlic.",
