    "summary": "This mousse is elegant, continental, sophisticated and incredibly easy. There's no cooking, no whipping and no fuss, and yet the results are as creamy and decadent as a confection that took hours to prepare. Made with the delectable flavor of sweet potatoes, it's nutritious and delicious. Each serving provides 350% of the Daily Value for vitamin A and 15% of the Daily Value for vitamin C--not bad for a bit of decadence.",
