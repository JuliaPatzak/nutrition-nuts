    "summary": "This is a recipe that my family has created for a portable breakfast. It uses a bread machine for the dough preparation. The filling can be with a variety of things. We like the sausage, cheese, and hash browns for a breakfast meal. I prepare the recipe by filling the kolaches the night before, and keeping them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, I set out the kolaches to warm to room temperature while the oven is preheating, and then cook them for a quick, hot breakfast.",
