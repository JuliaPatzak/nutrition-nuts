    "summary": "Toasty brown butter and coarsely chopped white chocolate give traditional snickerdoodle cookies a decadent upgrade in this wow-worthy recipe. Preparing and cooling brown butter requires a little more time--but the rich, nutty flavor is so worth it. In addition to their incredible flavor, these snickerdoodles have a fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth consistency, thanks to the cream cheese in the dough. You'll definitely want to bookmark this one for the holidays, but don't be surprised if you come back to these next-level snickerdoodles all year long.",
