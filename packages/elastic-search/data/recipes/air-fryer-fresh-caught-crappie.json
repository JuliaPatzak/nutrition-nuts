    "summary": "When spring is in the air, fried crappie is what all of the fishermen around here are talking about. This year I left the deep-fryer in the cabinet and used my air fryer for a healthier alternative. Serve with malt vinegar, tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot pepper sauce, or the condiments of your choice.",
