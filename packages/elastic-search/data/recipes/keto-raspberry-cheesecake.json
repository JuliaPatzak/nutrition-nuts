        "Combine almond flour, butter, sweetener, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a food processor",
        "Pulse until crust mixture has turned into pea-sized crumbs that stick together when squeezed",
        "Transfer mixture to the prepared springform pan and press into a crust covering the entire bottom of the pan in an even layer",
        "Bake crust in the preheated oven until edges start to crisp, about 10 minutes",
        "Remove from oven and allow to cool",
        "Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)",
        "Combine cream cheese and powdered sweetener in the bowl of a stand mixer",
        "Beat on medium speed until smooth and completely combined",
        "Scrape down sides of the bowl as needed",

        "Remove cheesecake from oven and run a knife around the inside edge of the pan",
        "Leave cheesecake in the pan and cool on a wire rack until room temperature",
