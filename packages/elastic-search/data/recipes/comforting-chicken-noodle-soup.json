        "While broth is simmering, whisk flour and salt together in a bowl; beat in the eggs, butter, and enough milk to make a stiff but workable dough",
        "Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth and slightly springy, about 5 minutes; transfer to a bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to rest for 10 minutes",
        "Roll the noodle dough out on a floured surface to desired thickness (1/4- to 1/8-inch thick); cut into strips",

        "Place strained broth into a large soup pot, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low",
        "Stir in bouillon cubes, 3 tablespoons of chopped ginger, 3/4 cup sliced carrots, and celery until the bouillon has dissolved",
        "Simmer until the carrots are tender, about 30 minutes",
        "Gently stir in the noodles, a few at a time",
        "Return broth to a simmer and cook until the noodles are tender, about 10 minutes",
        "Whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup of water until smooth; stir half the mixture into the soup and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes",
        "If thicker soup is desired, stir in remaining cornstarch mixture",
        "Mix in the chicken to serve"
