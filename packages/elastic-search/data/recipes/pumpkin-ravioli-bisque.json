    "summary": "More like a ravioli with pumpkin sauce, this is a wonderful mix of sweet and spicy. If it is too sweet, use a can of solid packed pumpkin in place of the pumpkin pie filling and use more broth and some pumpkin pie spice. I've made it both ways, and both are great. My husband preferred it with the pumpkin pie mix. Modify the cayenne pepper to taste; we like it spicy so we use 2 teaspoons!",
