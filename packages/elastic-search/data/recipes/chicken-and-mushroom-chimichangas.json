    "summary": "This is not Mexican food. It's a 100% American invention. They are not deep fried; they are pan-fried in a little oil. I like to serve with dollops of guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. Moist chicken and earthy mushrooms combine with fresh green chiles and pepperjack cheese encased in a crispy tortilla.",
