    "summary": "Uncle Bo was my dad's college roommate. He created these sandwiches and served them up at Friday night parties before Penn State football games. I found this recipe some years back hidden in my mother's recipe box and decided to make them. They're great now for sitting in front of the big screen watching football--and football season is fast upon us. Make these for your crowd.",
