    "summary": "Chili is one of my favorite ways to utilize the abundance of ground meat you get with a deer. I like to use my Instant Pot\u00ae to eliminate the mess it makes on the stovetop as it simmers. It is also done much quicker. I haven't seen a recipe here so I thought I would share. Top with sour cream, cheese, and onions if desired.",
