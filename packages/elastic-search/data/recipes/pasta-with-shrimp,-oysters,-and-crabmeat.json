    "summary": "This recipe came from my mother-in-law. Their family tradition was to have fish on Christmas Eve. I carried on that tradition with my own family. If you don't care for oysters, like me, then simply omit that step. The key is use fresh ingredients, not dried. My guests can't get enough of this--it'swell worth the effort! Serve with garlic bread.",
