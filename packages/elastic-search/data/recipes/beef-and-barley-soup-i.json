    "summary": "We are remodeling the kitchen and getting very hungry for food again so I got out the slow cooker and made this soup.  It's perfect when you do not have a lot of time.  Since you can get soup bones that contain little fat, this soup is nearly fat-free.  When the soup is cooled there is no visible fat at the surface.",
