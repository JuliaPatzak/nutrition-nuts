    "summary": "I used a similar recipe to this as a base for my first time cooking salmon. I added some extras to the honey-mustard sauce and thought of making the white wine sauce while the salmon was cooking. My wife, who hates fish, not only loved it, but asked me to make it again the next day. Needless to say, we've found a way to bring fish into our home. Green beans and wild rice is a great side for this salmon. Serve with lemon wedges.",
