    "summary": "This is one of my most-requested dishes, and it's perfect for Easter, Thanksgiving, or anytime you need a fancy side dish. It looks much more difficult to make than it is, and guests are always impressed! Even people who don't like sweet potatoes ask for second helpings! I hope you enjoy it too. Maple syrup can be substituted for the vanilla extract.",
