    "summary": "I'm a huge fan of raita but I always find myself wanting more veggies in it. So over time I developed this recipe. It's high in protein and tastes great. I've largely given up on dipping anything in it. I just eat it by the spoonful. The recipe takes a while, but it makes enough to merit it.",
