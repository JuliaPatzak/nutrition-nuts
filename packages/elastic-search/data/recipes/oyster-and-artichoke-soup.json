    "summary": "Rich, buttery soup with pieces of artichoke heart and oyster. If you love oysters or artichokes you can add half-again as much of these ingredients. You can also use 1 pint each heavy cream and half-half for a less rich soup. This soup does not freeze well so don't cook more than you can eat within a few days!",
