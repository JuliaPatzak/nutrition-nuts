    "summary": "Here is an easy recipe that makes muffins much better than store-bought and is also a good way to use your extra sourdough. I found this recipe on a website called 'The Fresh Loaf' and tweaked a few of the details based on my experience. There is some amount of planning ahead needed as you have to start the night before, but it is definitely worth it.",
