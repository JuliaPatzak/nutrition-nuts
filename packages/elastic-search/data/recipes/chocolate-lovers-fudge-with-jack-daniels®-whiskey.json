    "summary": "This dense, rich fudge has a special secret--a couple of shots of Jack Daniel's\u00ae Whiskey! Not enough to overpower, but there is just enough to let you know it's there. No special equipment is required other than a double boiler, and if you don't have one, you can create one by using a bowl or smaller pot over a larger pot for the hot water. Just make sure the smaller bowl or pot doesn't touch the water as it bubbles. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer.",

        "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",
        "1 teaspoon kosher salt"

    "directions": [
        "Pour whiskey into a small bowl, add pecan halves, and allow them to soak in the whiskey for about 3 hours",
        "Line 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil",
        "Cut 2 pieces of foil about 14 inches long, and cut or fold each to an 8- inch width",
        "Cover the bottom and 2 sides of the pan from left to right with 1 piece of foil",
        "Use the remaining foil piece to cross the first layer of foil from top to bottom of the pan",

        "Place milk and dark chocolate in the top of a double boiler over 1 inch of simmering water",

        "Add melted butter and salt, stirring continuously",
        "Mix in reserved whiskey and stir until mixture is creamy and smooth",
