    "summary": "Based on my father-in-laws recipe, these fish cakes use salt cod. Trust me, it is worth the effort to find the salt cod. The slight saltiness of the cod brings out a whole new dimension of flavor. Who knows fish better than a Portuguese fishing Capt? Even Emeril would be proud! Serve with a good tartar sauce.",
