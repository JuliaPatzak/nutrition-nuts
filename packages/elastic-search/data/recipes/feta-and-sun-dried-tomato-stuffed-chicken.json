    "summary": "This is an easy stuffed chicken breast that is absolutely yummy. I listed the olives as optional because I do not like olives, but I have made it with them for my husband (who loves olives) and he said it was very good.  This dish goes really nicely with couscous and a Greek-style salad.",
