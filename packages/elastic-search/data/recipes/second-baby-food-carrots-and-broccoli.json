    "summary": "This is a great combination for growing babies (6-9 months or older). You can mix up the veggies with what's in season or what you have around the house. I like to use green beans instead of broccoli sometimes. I make sure I label my zip-top bag with the date I made it! Make some on a free night to use for a few weeks!",
