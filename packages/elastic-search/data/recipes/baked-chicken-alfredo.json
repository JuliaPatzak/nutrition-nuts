    "summary": "This recipe is quick and easy and any novice cook can do it. It was made for the little ones who always wanted to order out at Pizza Hut\u00ae or Olive Garden\u00ae. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese if desired. This recipe can also be eaten without being baked but the kids love that it resembles baked casseroles found in restaurants.",
