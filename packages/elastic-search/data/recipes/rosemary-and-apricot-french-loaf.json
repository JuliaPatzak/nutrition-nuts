    "summary": "This is a sweet bread that seems quite fancy and is actually not much more work than a simple French loaf. I went to an Irish bakery once and they had apricot bread. In my imagination, this is the recipe I was thinking of so I made this up when the Irish bakery didn't read my mind.",
