    "summary": "Simple tasty baked fish recipe with that Cajun kick. Good for any flaky white fish fillets but catfish is the classic.  Be careful how you mix the Dijon and the hot sauce, one overpowers the other or the two overpower the fish. I like to sprinkle some strong paprika (i.e. cayenne) at presentation for effect. Garnish with lemon wedges.",
