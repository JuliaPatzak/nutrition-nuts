    "summary": "This is a very old sweet and sour cocktail recipe; I remember looking forward to it as a kid at my Mom's holiday parties. It will look horrible and smell worse when first in the pan, but just wait. Don't ever tell what's in the sauce until after your guests have tasted it (otherwise they'll never try it). Serve with toothpicks; keep warm with a fondue pot.",
