    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups all-purpose flour",
        "1 tablespoon baking powder",
        "1 tablespoon sugar",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "3 tablespoons vegan butter (such as Earth Balance\u00ae)",
        "3 tablespoons coconut oil",
        "1 cup cold unsweetened almond milk, or as needed"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Line a baking pan with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat, such as SILPAT\u2122",
        "Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl",
        "Cut in vegan butter and coconut oil with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs",
        "Slowly add cold almond milk and stir until dough just comes together",
        "It may not be necessary to use all the milk; dough will be wet and sticky",
        "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead (fold over) 15 times",
        "Gently roll or pat dough to a 1- or 1 1/2-inch thickness",
        "Cut biscuits with a small biscuit cutter or a small bourbon glass",
        "Gently re-roll the dough scraps and cut remaining biscuits",
        "Place biscuits on the prepared baking sheet",
        "Be sure they are touching each other and the sides of the pan; don't be afraid to squish them in--this helps them to rise high",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes"
