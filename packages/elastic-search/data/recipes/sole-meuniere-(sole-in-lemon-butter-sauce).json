    "summary": "This classic French method of cooking fish is actually super easy and fast, and every time I make it the reviews are outstanding from children and adults alike. This is a restaurant-caliber recipe that you truly can prepare in 15 minutes! For fussy eaters, I cut back on the lemon juice a little. I like to serve this with ratatouille. Serve with lemon wedges.",
