    "summary": "This dinner bowl recipe comes together in mere minutes and appeals to vegans and omnivores alike. To bring this meal together even faster, make the avocado-cilantro sauce earlier in the day. We like to keep the corn raw for extra crunch and a fresh flavor, but feel free to use cooked, frozen and thawed, or canned corn kernels, if that's what you prefer.",
