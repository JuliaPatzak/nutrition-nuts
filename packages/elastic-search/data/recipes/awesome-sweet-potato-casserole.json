    "summary": "This recipe was given to me in the late 1980s by Diane Thornton in Jackson Mississippi.  I have made it each year since, and when I bring it to gatherings people rave about it, so I bring it year after year.  Some people say it's more like a desert than a side dish. All I know is that it's a standby for me and always gets a nod.",
