    "summary": "Even though I live in balmy south Florida, where it is pretty much summer year round, I still like to 'get into' the seasons by cooking something festive and seasonally appropriate. I started slowly spiking my recipes with ultra-healthy ingredients (flax, wheat germ, hemp seeds, chickpea puree, etc.) This is a vegetarian and dairy-free recipe.",
