    "summary": "I purposely cook a whole corned beef just to make hash.  There's nothing like the taste of fresh versus canned hash.  This is also good for leftover St. Paddy's Day corned beef.  I throw the carrot in for color, claiming it's the Leprechaun's gold. Serve with fried eggs and brown soda bread (farls).",
