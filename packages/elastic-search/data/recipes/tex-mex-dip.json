    "summary": "This fast, easy dip can be served as a main dish or as an appetizer. Depending on the ingredients, it can be mild to medium. This really needs to be served warm, as it has a layer of cheese that gets firm when cool. It reheats well, but is best when fresh. Serve with plain tortilla chips.",
