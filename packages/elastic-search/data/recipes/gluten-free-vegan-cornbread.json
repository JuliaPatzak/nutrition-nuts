    "summary": "I'm always looking for traditional foods I can make when my mom comes over for dinner. She is on a very strict gluten-free, vegan diet so there are not a lot of options that are simple or cheap. This cornbread turned out a little dense but soft, kind of like the outside of a tamale with a semi-crisp crust. The whole family enjoyed it!",
