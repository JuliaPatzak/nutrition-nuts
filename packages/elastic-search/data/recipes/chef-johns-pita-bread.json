        "Mix at low speed, using a dough hook attachment, until dough is soft, supple, and slightly sticky",
        "If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add up to 1/4 cup more flour, a little at a time",
        "Knead dough with machine on low speed until slightly springy and still soft, 5 to 6 minutes",
        "Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a ball",
        "Wipe inside of bowl with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil",

        "Let dough round rest for 5 minutes",
        "Repeat with remaining dough balls",
        "Brush a cast-iron skillet with remaining 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat",

        "Pita bread will begin to puff up and fill with hot air",
