    "summary": "This creamy fall favorite is perfect for those following a keto or low-carb diet, and the whole family will love it! I use bone broth if I have it on hand, however chicken stock works just as well. Use a keto-friendly brown sugar substitute that measures 1:1 like sugar, such as Lakanto\u00ae Golden or Swerve\u00ae Brown Sugar Substitute.",
