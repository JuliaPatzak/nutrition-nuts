    "summary": "If you don't like the dry yolks and rubbery whites in traditional hard-boiled eggs, try making them using your sous vide immersion cooker. The yolks come out super moist and tender and never discolored, which makes the added cook time well worth the wait! Use any number of eggs; the directions remain the same.",
