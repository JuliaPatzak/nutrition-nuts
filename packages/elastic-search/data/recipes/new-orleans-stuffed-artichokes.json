        "Prepare the artichokes by slicing off the bottoms of the stems and trimming the tips of the leaves",
        "It is easiest to use scissors for the leaves",
        "Tear off the small leaves around the base and discard",
        "Place the artichokes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover",
        "Place a dinner plate on top of them to keep the artichokes from floating out of the water",
        "Cover with a lid and bring to a boil",
        "Boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until some of the leaves are floating in the water; drain and cool",

        "Place an artichoke in the center of a square and tuck about 1/2 teaspoon of the cheese mixture under each leaf",

        "Place a wire rack or steamer insert into the bottom of the large pot",
        "fill with about 3 inches of fresh water, or so that the artichokes remain above water level",
