    "summary": "Store-bought marinated artichokes are too expensive and are consumed faster than the time it takes to open the jar. I created this recipe with simple ingredients that are already found in the kitchen. It's delicious by itself, but feel free to experiment and even make your own artichoke salad. It's not like the real deal...it's better! Enjoy immediately or chill the marinated artichokes for at least an hour before serving.",
