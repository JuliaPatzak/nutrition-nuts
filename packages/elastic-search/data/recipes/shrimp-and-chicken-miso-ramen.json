    "summary": "Absolutely delicious, light, healthy Japanese-style noodles in a miso broth, with seared shrimp and chicken. Quick, easy and so good, you will love. I guarantee. Some of the ingredients might be difficult to find if you live outside a city, but it's absolutely worth going to an Asian/Japanese supermarket to find them! Also, they tend to keep well - so spend $10 on them now and you can make this lots of times.",
