    "summary": "This semi-frozen cinnamon smoothie with 'cookie dough' chews throughout is the perfect kid treat for the holidays.  They'll never guess it's 100% superfood, good for their little guts, or counteracting the sugar rushes in the treats they bring home from school. For this recipe, use strong, fresh, organic spices to drown out the banana flavor and make it a true, cinna-yum experience.",
