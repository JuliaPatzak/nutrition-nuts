    "summary": "Banana, walnut, and chocolate are always an amazing combination of ingredients, no matter what the delivery system, but it really doesn't get any better than in this ganache-frosted cupcake. A close second would be a chocolate-dipped frozen banana, rolled in walnuts, which is also a great treat, although much more awkward to eat in public. Feel free to omit the frosting and just enjoy these as muffins.",
