    "summary": "I've loved instant ramen noodles since I was a kid, but as an adult I wanted to incorporate some nutrition into them and also more flavor. Sure, you can make this on the stovetop but the beauty of using the Instant Pot\u00ae is that you throw it all in, walk away, and the veggies all get evenly cooked. No more mushy peas and underdone carrots. I like to make a batch and separate it into \"to go\" containers for weekday lunches.",
