    "summary": "I don't like fruit cake but I love this. We grew up with this every Christmas. It's a little tangy, very moist, and can be dressed up for company or kept simple if you want. It freezes well, but we've never had leftovers when there was only one cake around! (And no one has ever complained about \"fruitcake\"!)",
