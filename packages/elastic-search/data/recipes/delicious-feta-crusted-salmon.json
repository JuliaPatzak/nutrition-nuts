    "summary": "I first created this dish when my family suggested I try something other than the same tired (yet still yummy) Asian salmon dish. I whipped this up out of ingredients I had on hand. They thanked me profusely. Now I have a new dish to use. It's pretty rich in flavor, but not so high in fat (depending on what kind of ingredients you use). Enjoy!",
