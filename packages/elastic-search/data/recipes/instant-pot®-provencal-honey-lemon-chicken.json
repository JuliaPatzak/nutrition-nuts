    "summary": "I love the blend of herbes de Provence, honey, lemon, and lavender. The acidity of the lemon perfectly balances the sweetness of the honey. This dish is always a hit and all five of my children cheer when I place this on the table. I use an Instant Pot\u00ae, but this recipe can be easily adapted to be baked in the oven instead. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family does.",
