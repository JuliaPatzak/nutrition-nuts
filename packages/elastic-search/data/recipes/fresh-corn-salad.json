    "summary": "I created this fresh corn salad to serve with our lobster dinners that we have about once a month (seafood Sunday).  I wanted to do something outside of the traditional sides like corn on the cob and potato. It's now a family favorite! Goes well with a grilled steak or tuna steak as well. The combination of sweet with the corn and salty with the feta is an unexpected delight!",
