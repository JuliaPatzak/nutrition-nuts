    "summary": "This garlic and shrimp recipe is delicious. It's a snap to assemble. This recipe will soon be a family favorite. The true way to eat this dish is to leave the shrimp unpeeled and slurp the butter out and then peel the shrimp and eat them. Personally, I like to peel our serving of shrimp into a bowl, drizzle the peeled shrimp with the seasoned garlic butter, and eat with a big chunk of crusty bread for dipping. However you eat it, you will love it!",
