    "summary": "Corned beef used to be a weekend only treat for me due to how long it took to cook, until I discovered the Instant Pot\u00ae. Save yourself time and hassle by letting your Instant Pot\u00ae do all of the work for you, and in a fraction of the time. You can have it and all of the fixings on your table in 2 hours. If you decide to fix cabbage, be sure to keep it in large wedges so that it does not overcook.",
