    "summary": "This is my Chinese husband's grandmother's recipe. We usually add it into our milk. Way awesome. You can even sprinkle it over mochi (rice cake). I've actually added into my banana bread recipe and it's sooooooooooooo good!! My husband raves about it. Have to try this! Use it in whatever sounds good to you. Milk, oatmeal, banana bread, on rice cakes, or even on toasted bread. Get creative. You may also add in some sugar depending on your taste. Enjoy!",
