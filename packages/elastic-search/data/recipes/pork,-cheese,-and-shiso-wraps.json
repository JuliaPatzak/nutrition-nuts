    "summary": "In Japan, pork, cheese, and perilla leaves (shiso) are a common food combo. They can be cooked in many ways. I've tried rolling the ingredients together and wrapping them with some leftover shumai wrappers that I have on the fridge and steamed it in the microwave. The wrappers served as an agent so the pork rolls won't open while cooking and it worked well. It's delicious.",
