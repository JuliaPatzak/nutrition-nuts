    "summary": "This recipe is great for hibachi on the beach or in your backyard.  You can also broil it in your oven if you're not in Hawaii or near a beach.  It's a easy way to prepare a shrimp dish that's 'ono' (delicious) and moist!  You can serve this either as an appetizer (pupu) or entree.  I prepare it either with or without the shells on - depending on how fast I want people to eat 'um up! Aloha from Hawaii!!!  Enjoy!",
