    "summary": "This is an easy recipe I got from a Korean college friend of mine. She made it for a cultural event on campus, and it was a hit! It has plenty of ummph to counteract the blandness of the tofu. Also, this frying style is typical Korean.  According to my friend you can fry just about anything this way (she also made zucchini and a vegetable-crab pancake this way).",
