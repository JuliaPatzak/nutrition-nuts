    "summary": "This is a great savory pork roast that is excellent when paired with a sweet squash dish, greens, and Jasmine rice.  Pair with your favorite Chardonnay. Cut into 3/8-inch slices, serve over rice, and don't forget to pour drippings over the pork and rice. Absolutely delicious. You can use any white wine in place of the Chardonnay.",
