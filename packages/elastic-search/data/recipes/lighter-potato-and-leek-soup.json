    "summary": "From grandma, a wholesome Depression Era soup, without butter or cream. Takes a little longer to cook, but the flavors meld into an exquisite homemade light potato and leek soup you'll make again and again. Garnish with nonfat sour cream if desired. Butter and cream lovers can add a swirl of cream and a pat of butter on top of their servings.",
