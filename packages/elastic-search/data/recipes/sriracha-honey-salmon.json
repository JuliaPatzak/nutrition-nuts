    "summary": "This is a slightly American take on the sriracha craze sweeping the nation. The honey and soy sauce give a twist to what would be hoisin sauce. The jalapeno and onion go nicely with the sriracha flavor. This dish is some what similar to the flavors that would be added to a bowl of pho. It's inexpensive and easy.",
