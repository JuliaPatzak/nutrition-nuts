    "summary": "This patty melt recipe is phenomenal, but is nothing remotely close to a health food. I highly suggest this for an occasional treat or to accompany some beers, peers, and sports. I've developed this recipe from a combination of other recipes over time and out of practicality based on what was in my kitchen at the time of experiment. I purposely left out Worcestershire and other burger flavorings to keep it simple and not detract from the Thousand Island-like sauce. Serve with french fries or hash browns.",

    "ingredients": [
        "6 slices rye bread",
        "6 tablespoons butter, softened",
        "1 pound ground beef",
        "\u00be teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "\u00bd teaspoon sea salt",
        "\u00bc teaspoon onion powder",
        "3 tablespoons mayonnaise",
        "2 tablespoons ketchup",
        "1 tablespoon real bacon bits",
        "1 teaspoon sweet relish",
        "1 teaspoon white sugar",
        "6 slices Cheddar cheese",
        "6 slices provolone cheese"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Cover 1 side of each bread slice thoroughly and generously with butter; set aside",
        "Mix ground beef, pepper, salt, and onion powder together in a bowl until thoroughly combined, but do not overmix or meat will not have the proper consistency after it is cooked",
        "Form 3 patties to fit the shape of the bread",
        "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat",
        "Add patties and cook for 2 to 3 minutes",
        "Flip, making sure patties do not break, and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes",
        "Reduce heat to low, and cook until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes more",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)",
        "While the burgers are cooking, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, bacon bits, relish, and sugar for sauce in a small bowl",
        "Stir until mayonnaise and ketchup are well binded",
        "Heat another large skillet over medium-low heat",
        "Place 1 slice bread in the skillet, buttered-side down",
        "Top with 2 slices Cheddar cheese, a cooked patty, and 2 slices provolone cheese",
        "Spread a thin layer of sauce on the unbuttered side of a second slice of bread, and place sauce-side down on top of provolone",
        "Repeat to make remaining patty melts, working in batches if necessary",
        "Cook until bread is lightly toasted and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side"
