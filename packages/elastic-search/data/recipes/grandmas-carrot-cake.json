    "summary": "This recipe has been a favorite in our family for three generations. Different from traditional carrot cakes, this cake is extremely moist and flavorful and is topped with a buttermilk glaze while still warm. Try it and I think you will agree that it is the best!!   Be certain to reduce the baking temperature to 325 degrees F(165 degrees C) if using a glass baking pan.",
