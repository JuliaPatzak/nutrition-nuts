    "summary": "Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. While my husband and I eat 1 or 2 each, she easily finishes at least 3! The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal! Extra-lean ground chicken can be substituted with ground turkey with great results.",
