    "summary": "I call this my 'famous Seamus' pot roast because my tiny Siamese cat, Seamus, sat in the kitchen the entire time this pot roast was cooking. I've been making this recipe for 40+ years and I just throw the ingredients together; it's very forgiving. My son-in-law also says it's the best thing he ever ate. When boys hang around the oven, it can't be bad.",
