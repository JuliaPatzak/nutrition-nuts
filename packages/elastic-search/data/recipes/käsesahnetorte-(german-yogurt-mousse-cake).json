    "summary": "In Germany, the filling for this classic cake (called K\u00e4sesahnetorte) is make with quark but quark is not easy to find in the US and quite pricey. I use Greek yogurt instead, and it tastes just the like to original. The cake needs to set for at least 4 hours in the fridge, and it tastes better on the second day so I always make it the day before.",
