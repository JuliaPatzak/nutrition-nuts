    "summary": "Spicy miso and mushroom ramen, an outstanding as well as distinguished noodle soup dish, is a national obsession in Japan. Though the dish was originally imported from China, it has been widely popular in Japan in the recent decades. The intense savor along with the scalding slurp of the dish is certainly enough to explain why this dish has become vastly famous in the region. Now it claims to be the part of the 21st century food culture of Japan and is approaching to be a global cult. The dish is, however, lighter than the traditional Japanese ramen.",
