    "summary": "When Meyer lemons are in season, typically between November and March, be sure to snag some up to make this lemon-Parmesan dressing. Meyer lemons are much less tart and acidic than traditional lemons, like a cross between a lemon and a mandarin. They're also sweeter, so no additional sugar is needed. I love this on kale salad, but also drizzled over roasted veggies or grilled salmon or trout.",
