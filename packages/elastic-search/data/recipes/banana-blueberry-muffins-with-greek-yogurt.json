    "summary": "With blueberries in season, what better way to prepare them than to combine with a banana muffin base? The use of whole wheat flour and replacing much of the sugar in a traditional banana muffin recipe with natural sources like honey, Greek yogurt, and applesauce results in a moist, dense texture. These banana-blueberry muffins make a light, satisfying breakfast or dessert.",
