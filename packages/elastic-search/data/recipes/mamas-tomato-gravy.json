    "summary": "This dish is truly a taste of Louisiana Cajun Country. I mean where folks are already sitting at the table drinking coffee and eating breakfast by the time the rooster crows. Mama made countless batches of biscuits and tomato gravy in her lifetime. I'm sure she learned to make this from her mother: Carmen Inez Shirley. This is the dish that puts my feet back under my mama's table. Serve with love over hot buttermilk biscuits along with bacon or sausage for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.",
