    "summary": "'Tarte\u00a0a\u00a0la Moutarde\u00a0et a\u00a0la\u00a0Tomate,'\u00a0the French tomato tart with mustard, is one of my favorite things to make with fresh ripe tomatoes. But after cutting, it starts looking a bit messy, so for guests, I bake these mini tarts. The low-fat crust is like a German Quark-Oelteig which I make with Greek yogurt (easier to find in the United States than quark, and less expensive).",
