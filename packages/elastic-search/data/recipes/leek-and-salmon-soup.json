    "summary": "This is a soup that beautifully disguises the amount of veggies. My kids adore it. This is also the only way they will happily eat salmon. It's so tender and blends in so well with the leeks and veggies that they are happy when this turns up every 2 weeks or so. Serve with crusty bread to sop up the remains.",
