    "summary": "When I went to the grocery, l could not find ground beef. Ground bison was the last package on the shelf, so it went home with me. I made the family bison burgers in the air fryer, and they were better than burgers on the grill! Juicy, full of flavor, and the liquid smoke adds just the hint of a grill flavor. With a slice of Gouda and toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles, everyone commented on the burgers, and only I know they were bison, and not beef!",
