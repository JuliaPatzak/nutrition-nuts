    "summary": "Make these dill deviled eggs as usual, but instead of adding mayo add a little bit of dill pickle juice, red onions, fresh dill, then your mayonnaise, using about 1/2 of what you normally would. Finish it off with a teaspoon of mustard and a dash of paprika. Just a nice mix to the classic.",
