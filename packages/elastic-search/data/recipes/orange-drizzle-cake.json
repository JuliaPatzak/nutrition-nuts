    "summary": "Cake. Citrus. One-bowl baking. If these words send a shiver down your spine, then this recipe is for you. It is a very easy recipe that can be different every time you make it if you swap the oranges for lemons, limes, grapefruit, or a mix of juices. You get a not-too-sweet, moist cake that will be gone before the day is over. Remember to use exact measurements to get perfect results.",
