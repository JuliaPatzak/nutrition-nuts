    "summary": "This is a fun and tasty, easy-to-make recipe. Mexican fajita shrimp are served with a surprisingly crunchy tostada base! Timing is important with this recipe. You want your fajita mixture to sizzle when you serve, so make sure to prepare all your fixings (lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers) before you cook the shrimp. Arrange fixings on a serving tray with shredded cheese and sour cream.",
