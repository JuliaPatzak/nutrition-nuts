    "summary": "This is a creamy, cheesy soup that I created several years ago. It makes for a hearty main dish and is also the perfect side to a roast or ham. Although I normally try to stay away from the canned cream soups, I think they fit well in this dish. Of course, it's not the healthiest of recipes, but don't we all need to splurge every now and then?",
