    "summary": "Who knew it was so quick and easy to make excellent gourmet-style popcorn? This recipe produces a very tasty snack. Popcorn was the last thing I used my microwave to cook. Now its retired. This is my personal favorite flavor combo, but you can vary the spices to suit your mood. A favorite combination for movie night with the girls is garlic powder and dried cilantro... Yum!",
