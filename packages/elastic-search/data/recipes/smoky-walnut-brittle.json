    "summary": "The traditional peanut brittle gets an update by using walnuts that are toasted, plus an addition of smokehouse rub found at Winco\u00ae (1745 is the bin number). Instead of using traditional corn syrup, I swapped to Lyle's\u00ae golden syrup; I believe it gave a deeper, richer taste. I absolutely recommend using a nonstick saucepan and a silicone spatula, because this mixture is rather sticky",
