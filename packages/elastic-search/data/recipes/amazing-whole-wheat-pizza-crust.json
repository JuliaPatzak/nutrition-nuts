    "ingredients": [
        "1 teaspoon white sugar",
        "1\u2009\u00bd cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)",
        "1 tablespoon active dry yeast",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "2 cups whole wheat flour",
        "1\u2009\u00bd cups all-purpose flour"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water",
        "Sprinkle yeast over the top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy",
        "Stir the olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture, then mix in the whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour until dough starts to come together",
        "Tip dough out onto a surface floured with the remaining all-purpose flour, and knead until all of the flour has been absorbed, and the ball of dough becomes smooth, about 10 minutes",
        "Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface",
        "Cover loosely with a towel, and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour",
        "When the dough is doubled, tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 2 pieces for 2 thin crust, or leave whole to make one thick crust",
        "Form into a tight ball",
        "Let rise for about 45 minutes, until doubled",
        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Roll a ball of dough with a rolling pin until it will not stretch any further",
        "Then, drape it over both of your fists, and gently pull the edges outward, while rotating the crust",
        "When the circle has reached the desired size, place on a well oiled pizza pan",
        "Top pizza with your favorite toppings, such as sauce, cheese, meats, or vegetables",
        "Bake for 16 to 20 minutes (depending on thickness) in the preheated oven, until the crust is crisp and golden at the edges, and cheese is melted on the top"
