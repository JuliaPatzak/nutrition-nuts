    "summary": "This is a home-style Italian favorite at my house. It is also very good with northern white beans instead of the chickpeas, and any sort of strand pasta works well. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty Italian bread. If you like spicy food, stir in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes towards the end.",
