    "summary": "My mother-in-law hails from the small town of Alpoyeca, Guerrero in Mexico. She makes the most delicious Enchiladas Verdes, and I wanted to share this authentic Mexican recipe with everyone. A word of warning, I am not going to alter her recipe so people who can't handle spiciness might want to add more water or less jalapenos. Enjoy!",
