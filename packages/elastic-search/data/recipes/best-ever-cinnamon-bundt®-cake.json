If you are a cinnamon fanatic, you have to give this recipe a try. This cake has just the right amount of cinnamon flavor and is so soft, moist, and fluffy. You can kick it up a notch and add walnuts or pecans, or better yet, a crumb topping. You can drizzle with simple syrup or glaze or dust with powdered sugar.",
