    "summary": "Using pantry items plus a couple of fresh items, you can create a cheesy, comforting casserole your whole family will love. Though it does include RO*TEL\u00ae and a can of mild green chile peppers, it's not spicy, but if you like the heat, choose hot RO*TEL\u00ae and peppers. This pantry chicken casserole reheats well, too, but I had to hide it, or there would have been no night #2! A crusty bread and a green salad complete this easy pantry meal.",
