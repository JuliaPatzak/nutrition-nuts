    "summary": "Here's a super easy, super simple method for making stuffed pasta using wonton wrappers. If you'd rather call these crab wontons or crab dumplings (or even cheater tortellini!), go ahead. No matter what you call them, this is definitely something you want in your bag of culinary tricks. They're loaded with crab and the tortellini shape does a great job of catching and holding on to all the delicious sauce.",

        "Place 1 tablespoon crab filling right in the center and press to spread it out a bit",
        "Pull the bottom wonton corner up and over the filling, line it up with the top corner to form a triangle, and work your way down the sides, pressing and sealing the wonton edges and pushing out any air",
