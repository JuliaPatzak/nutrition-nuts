    "summary": "After traveling through Thailand for the first time over 10 years ago, I became enamored with the cuisine. This curry recipe is the result of many years of subtle refinements and fine tuning with an interesting Canadian twist! It's worth the effort to find fresh lemon grass and either fresh or freshly frozen kaffir lime leaves. Serve hot with basmati or jasmine rice.",
