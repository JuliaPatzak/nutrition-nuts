    "summary": "I got a challah recipe from my husband and tweaked it to use spelt flour. This recipe makes a beautiful 2-pound braided challah. I like to divide the dough in 3; make two loaves and one little roll. I like to try different toppings each time I make this recipe, such as sesame seeds, dried onion flakes, granulated garlic, kosher salt, or flax seeds.",
