    "summary": "Recently the internet went wild for a delicious Mississippi pot roast wherein beef is braised in a slow cooker with butter, pepperoncini, and packets of powdered au jus gravy and ranch dressing. Guessing that the MSG from the latter two ingredients explained all the rage, I decided to mimic the flavors using from-scratch seasonings and boneless short ribs. It came out really well, especially when served over mashed potatoes with a garnish of parsley.",
