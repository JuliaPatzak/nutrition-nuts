        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Make three slashes across each side of the fish using a sharp knife",
        "This will keep the fish from curling as it cooks",
        "Place the fish in a shallow baking dish or roasting pan",
        "Cover each side with fresh ginger, then green onions and tomatoes",
        "Season with sea salt",
        "Slice half of the lime and place the slices on top of the fish",
