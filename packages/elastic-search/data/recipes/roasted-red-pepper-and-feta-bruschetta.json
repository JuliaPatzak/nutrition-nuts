    "summary": "I'm not a big fan of bruschetta, but I love this recipe, and so does everyone I've made it for! This is just as good as anything from a restaurant. This recipe takes longer the first few times you do it, before you really get the hang of it. It is a bit of work, but trust me, it's worth it! Most likely, you won't have leftovers.",
