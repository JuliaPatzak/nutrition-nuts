    "summary": "Fresh chunks of tuna, ripe mango, and creamy avocado combine to make the perfect appetizer or a tasty lunch.  I love to eat this with lime-seasoned tortilla chips, but it's just as delicious served in lettuce cups. I try to keep the tuna, avocado and mango pieces between 1/4- and 1/2-inch in size. Best eaten same-day, but can be kept 1-2 days in fridge, keeping in mind that texture will change.",
