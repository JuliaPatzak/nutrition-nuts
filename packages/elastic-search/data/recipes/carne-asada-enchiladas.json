    "summary": "This recipe takes time but is pretty easy to put together and serve. A dish full of flavor, color, and texture and as close to Mexican as I know how to get. I served this family-style, letting everyone choose their own toppings of Greek yogurt, chipotle sauce, and guacamole. Refried beans and a fresh-from-the-garden tossed salad makes this one delicious and complete meal.",
