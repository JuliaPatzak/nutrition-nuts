    "summary": "Was looking for a quick and easy dinner for me and the man. Had leftover pizza dough that I like to use for flatbreads. It is simple to add veggies to meat mixture and play with the flavors! Feel free to add your favorite hot sauce for a spicier kick. Serve with a side salad to complete the meal. You can switch out ingredients as you like; turkey or chicken for beef or experiment with different cheeses. Fold flatbread like a taco and enjoy!",
