    "summary": "It has taken me years to perfect this recipe. Los Cucos is my favorite TexMex restaurant in Houston, and I used to eat there every 2 weeks, just so I would order a pint of red salsa to go to take home with me. I was addicted to the stuff, it's the best salsa in the world. I finally mastered my own version, which tastes nearly identical to Los Cucos's red salsa.",
