    "summary": "This creamy pork stew is one of my favorite cold weather dishes of all time. You can add squash, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, mushrooms, root vegetables--it's quite versatile. And if pork isn't your thing, this would be lovely with veal, beef, or chicken thighs. Serve on steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or noodles.",
