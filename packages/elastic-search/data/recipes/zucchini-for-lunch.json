    "summary": "This is one of my favorite dishes to make whenever I have some zucchini on hand. Some people tell me that it doesn't look so good, but once you try it, I think you'll like it. The mixture of vegetables, eggs, peppers and tomato sauce gives it color, besides some protein. You might like the taste better than the looks of it. Give it a shot, it won't kill yah!!",
