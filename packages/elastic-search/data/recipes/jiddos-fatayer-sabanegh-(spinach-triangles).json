        "In a small bowl, stir together yeast, sugar and hot water; set aside until bubbles form on the yeast's surface",
        "Stir in salt and olive oil",
        "Place flour in a large bowl, then stir in yeast mixture and bring mixture together to form a soft dough",

        "Cover dough with a clean towel and set aside to rest",
        "Coarsely chop the spinach",
        "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add spinach",
