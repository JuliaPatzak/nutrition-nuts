    "summary": "This is a delicious way to take advantage of early spring's flavorful asparagus. A great dish to accompany large, busy meals, as most of the work can be done ahead of time and the asparagus reheated with the tomatoes and garlic at the last minute while the roast (or whatever else) is resting. Also a delicious preparation for green beans in place of the asparagus.",
