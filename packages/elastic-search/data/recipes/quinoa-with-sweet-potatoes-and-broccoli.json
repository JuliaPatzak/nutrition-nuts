    "summary": "The flavors of the broccoli and sweet potatoes compliment each other wonderfully in this recipe! I wasn't sure if steaming the sweet potatoes was necessary or not.  It might be okay to skip that step.  However, I wasn't sure if they would get tender enough by just cooking them in oil, so I went ahead and did it and it turned out great!",
