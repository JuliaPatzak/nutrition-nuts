    "summary": "My mom threw this together for a family gathering one year at the last minute, and it is now the single most requested dish at every gathering...family or not! Wonderful shrimp and pasta salad that satisfies the carb crave and is healthier than some of the other options we have these days. Great for backyard barbecue with friends or a quiet dinner inside with family. Serve chilled. Add vinegar for an extra tang! Feel free to add olives, peppers, or whatever veggies you love. This recipe is very flexible and forgiving.",
