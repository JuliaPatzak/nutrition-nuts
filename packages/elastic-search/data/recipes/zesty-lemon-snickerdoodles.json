    "summary": "These cookies bake crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with a delicious citrus twist and a crunchy cinnamon-sugar coat. An absolute Christmas killer! They smell absolutely heavenly when being baked. Fairly easy to make and the kids will love rolling them in the cinnamon-sugar before you bake them! Excellent with hot tea, milk, and coffee. They're great for dipping and stay crispy after dunking!",
