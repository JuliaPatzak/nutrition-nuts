    "summary": "Great dish for Mexican night with lots of different possibilities. The best thing about this recipe is it can be served by itself for a main dish on Mexican night, or be eaten with tortilla chips as a dip or even rolled up in a tortilla as a taco, burrito, or enchilada. Garnish with green onions, avocado, tomatoes, or/and sour cream. Very versatile recipe. So enjoy and learn the many uses of oh so healthy quinoa.",
