    "summary": "This recipe was created in the Unitas mountain range by a Student Conservation Association trail crew. The beauty of this bread is it's versatility. If you don't have enough or any of an ingredient you can usually go without or substitute for it. So go ahead, add milk, eggs, oats, fruits or nuts. You can also try different flours and sweeteners.",

        "\u2153 cup honey",
        "3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
        "3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)",
        "2 tablespoons salt",

    "directions": [
        "In a large mixing bowl, dissolve honey and yeast in warm water",
        "Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes",
        "Stir in oil, salt and 4 cups of flour",
        "Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition",
        "When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 15 minutes",
        "The dough should be soft like a baby's butt and it should not stick to your hands",
        "Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil",
        "Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour",
        "Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface",
        "Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves",
        "Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans",
        "Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes",
        "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until loaves sound hollow when on the bottom",
        "Serve hot out of the oven or let cool and store for later"
