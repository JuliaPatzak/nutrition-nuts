    "summary": "This is a nice dish to serve guests for dinner or even at a special lunch. It's extremely presentable and will wow everybody at the table. Be sure to use the Japanese mayonnaise recommended in this recipe, not American-style mayonnaise because the flavors are entirely different. Japanese mayonnaise is more flat/sour tasting while American-style mayonnaise is extremely sweet. American-style mayonnaise will ruin the recipe completely.",
