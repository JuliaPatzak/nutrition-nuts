    "summary": "This is the result of my quest for perfectly creamy and flavorful hummus. We have many Middle Eastern restaurants in metro Detroit and I've always wanted to perfect the recipe at home. The secret to ultimate creaminess with this recipe is the Vitamix\u00ae blender, which really emulsifies the mixture so it's not grainy. Using a food processor in the past, it never came out smooth. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and lightly garnish with a dash of paprika or minced parsley if desired. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts on top when serving for a savory variation. Great with fresh baked pita, pretzels, or sliced vegetables.",
