    "summary": "Delicious egg bread made with eggs, orange zest, and anise egg wash for an \"eggstra\" special flavor! A slightly sweet bread good by itself or toasted, especially with coffee or tea. You can even use it for French toast or bread pudding. I make this every year for my family at Easter. A special treat they look forward to once a year! The colored eggs are great fun too and add to your holiday decor.",

        "Combine milk, oil, salt, orange extract, 2 eggs at room temperature, sugar, orange zest, 4 cups of flour, and yeast in a bread machine, in that order",
        "Set to Dough cycle and start the machine; be sure to peek inside while dough is mixing and add additional flour as needed to create a soft, but not wet, dough",
        "Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour",
        "Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat",
        "Reduce heat to a rapid simmer and add 4 whole eggs to soft boil",
        "Continue to simmer for 6 minutes",
        "Remove from heat and transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool quickly",
        "Punch risen dough down and turn onto a floured surface",
