    "summary": "I was making pasta salad for a picnic and noticed that I ran out of dressing. All I had was extra-virgin olive oil. So, that's all I used, with some salt. It was so much better this way. Everyone wanted the recipe and then couldn't believe that oil was the only thing on this salad. Please try it this way and if you don't agree, you can always add vinegar or something. But, I don't think you will.",
