    "summary": "A moist cornbread made with molasses.  It doesn't use any butter, because it really doesn't need it.  I came up with this one night when I was trying to make a cornbread sweetened with molasses.  When I was cooking it, I realized that I'd forgotten to put butter in it.  I ended up cooking it anyway, and it didn't need any.",
