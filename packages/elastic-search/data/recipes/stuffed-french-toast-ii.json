    "summary": "This is a nice change from ordinary French toast. I make this more than the standard recipe.  Although this is my family's favorite version, it is very versatile. You can substitute peanut butter for the cream cheese, use different jams or preserves, different extracts or spices - the options are practically limitless! Serve with maple syrup and sprinkle with powdered sugar.",
