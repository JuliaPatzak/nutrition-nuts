    "summary": "Although store-bought croutons come in a resealable bag, they still get stale quick. Homemade are simple to make and taste much better. I started making them in the oven but if you turn your back for a minute they can go from soft to burnt. I needed a low-maintenance method so I came up with this air fryer recipe that works perfectly every single time.",
