    "summary": "This corn dish is perfect as a side, used as a topping on a taco, mixed into a salad, with quinoa, or even served cold. I first discovered a similar dish at the Amigo Room inside The Ace Hotel in Palm Springs, CA. This was a staple of my diet in California and since I've moved to New York, I set out to perfect their recipe and put my own spin on it. This is my version, I hope you enjoy it!",
