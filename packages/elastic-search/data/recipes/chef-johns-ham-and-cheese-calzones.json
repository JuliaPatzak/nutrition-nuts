    "summary": "Today calzones are most commonly stuffed with the exact same toppings that go on a pizza which, besides the crust issue, was one of my main problems with it. I mean, why not just fold a pizza in half, and call it a day? So, I decided to do what I hear is a more traditional filling featuring ricotta, fresh mozzarella, and ham. The result was as enjoyable as it was surprising.",
