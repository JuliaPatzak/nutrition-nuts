    "summary": "A delicious, naturally low-sugar treat! The orange and spices are wonderful... the trick is to not let them overpower the pears. The lemon adds a brightness to the flavor, while the vanilla is balancing. Spread over toast or with meats such as ham, pork chops, or chicken. Makes an excellent gift too. Place improperly sealed or open jars in refrigerator and use within the month.",
