    "summary": "Underripe avocados are lightly pickled in brine that is tangy and slightly sweet. These are great to serve with your favorite burger, hot dog, or Tex-Mex dish. They make a snazzy addition to salads too! These are so addictive; I buy more underripe avocados than I do ripe ones now. I reuse the brine over and over. The brine can be reused by simply adding more avocados and allowing them to rest for 24 hours before consuming. These will last about 5 days in the refrigerator.",
