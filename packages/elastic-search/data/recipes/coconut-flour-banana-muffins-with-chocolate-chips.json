        "3  ripe bananas, mashed",
        "3 large eggs",
        "\u00bc cup coconut flour",
        "2 tablespoons coconut flour",
        "1 tablespoon stevia powder",

    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Line 10 muffin cups with paper liners",
        "Blend bananas, eggs, coconut flour, stevia, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk or a fork",
        "Stir in chocolate chips",
        "Pour mixture evenly between the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 1/2 inch from the top as these muffins won't rise as much as others",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes",
        "Cool for 5 minutes and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; the moisture from the bananas will leak through the liners a little and this is normal"
