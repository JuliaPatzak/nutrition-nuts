    "summary": "An easy and simple dish that is dressy enough for company or the holidays. It never fails to please guests but keeps your deli person busy with the waxed paper! The hardest part of this dish really is just wrapping the fish, which does not require any culinary skill whatsoever. Cod, sole, or similar white fish work equally well. Use dry sherry in place of white wine if desired.",
