    "summary": "This is a family favorite! Every time I serve this chicken, I get rave reviews! I serve this over coconut rice garnished with green onions. It makes a beautiful presentation. To make coconut rice, simply replace half of the water with coconut milk and cook rice as directed. This recipe makes a lot of marinade. If I am serving more people I will increase the amount of chicken and keep the recipe for the marinade the same. Goes really well with steamed broccoli or edamame.",
