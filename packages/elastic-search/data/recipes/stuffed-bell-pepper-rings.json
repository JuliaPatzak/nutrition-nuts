    "summary": "I use pepper rings instead of the usual whole peppers; since it takes less time to bake, there is more meat taste instead of mostly peppers, and they look so pretty on the plate, in my opinion. I love using colored peppers for a fun visual effect! Serve with sour cream, Greek-style sour cream, or nonfat yogurt.",
