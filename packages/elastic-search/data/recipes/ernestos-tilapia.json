    "summary": "My husband created this many years ago and we think it's just as good today as it was then! We prefer the grill to cook this, but the oven works fine. Cook in oven at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Eat the fish pepper/onion mixture on saltines with a squeeze of lime and a dash of hot sauce (such as Cholula\u00ae) and enjoy the flavorful broth with lime, hot sauce, and a spoon.",
