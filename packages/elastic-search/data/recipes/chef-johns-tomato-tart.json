    "summary": "One of these days Michele and I will travel to the south of France, where we'll eat this amazing tomato tart at least once a day. It's going to be hot, since we'll have to go in the middle of summer to enjoy best possible tomatoes, but that's fine, as long as there's chilled ros\u00e9. One layer of tomato is plenty, since more than that will make for an overly wet tart, which means your pastry will not stay crispy.",
