    "summary": "This Thai peanut noodle dish is a delicious recipe with just the right amount of heat! It's simple to prepare, but requires a bit of organization while assembling/cooking, because it goes quickly. Preparing your ingredients beforehand is key! For vegetarians, you can make this without the chicken and fish sauce and it tastes just as good! Serve hot. You could also garnish this with chopped unsalted peanuts.",
