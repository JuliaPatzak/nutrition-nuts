    "summary": "This was made for our family's lunch at the pool! In the summer time we spend most of our time together at the pool and BBQ-ing. But this was lunch so we wanted something, COLD, FAST, and of course TASTY! So, since I'm mostly European I thought my family would really enjoy something a little more NORMAL, to their palettes.",
