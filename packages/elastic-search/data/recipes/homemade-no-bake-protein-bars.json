    "summary": "This is one of my favorite protein bar recipes. They are so much cheaper than commercial bars, very healthy, and better-tasting. Kids love them (provided they like peanut butter)! Plus you know what the ingredients are. You can add anything - raisins, cranberries, dark chocolate nibs, coconut, etc. Keep refrigerated.",
