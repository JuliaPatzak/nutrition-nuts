    "summary": "This no-drain, fast, and yummy recipe for potato leek soup is creamy and resembles baked potato soup in its texture and cheesy goodness, but sneaks in some leeks. Serve hot, topped with green onion, bacon bits, and/or shredded Cheddar to your liking. Using the butter or yellow potatoes makes a difference in this recipe.",
