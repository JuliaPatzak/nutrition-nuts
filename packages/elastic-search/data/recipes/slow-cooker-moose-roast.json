    "summary": "I had a moose roast sitting in my freezer for a couple of months, because I had no idea how to cook it, not being a wild game fan.  A friend suggested this method of cooking it and it was delicious.  I made it at Christmas along with the turkey, thinking my guests could have a taste and I wouldn't have to feel guilty about it being in my freezer anymore, but it was the hit of the dinner!",
