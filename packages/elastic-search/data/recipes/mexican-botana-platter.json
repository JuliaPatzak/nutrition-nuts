    "summary": "Growing up at the very tip of Texas, this beef and chicken fajita, bean, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream recipe has always been an all-in-one hit at restaurants or any get together! Serve with Spanish rice and fresh warm flour tortillas! You can also use grilled shrimp or sausage as your meat and save time by using tortilla chips in the bag, but the taste won't be authentic.",
