    "summary": "I was looking for a healthier alternative to serve as an appetizer on pizza night. This took the place of greasy cheese sticks or fried wings, typical dishes to pair with pizza. The added bonus is that this is low in fat and delicious! My family gobbled them up, and I'm sure yours will too!",
