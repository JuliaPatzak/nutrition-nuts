    "summary": "This cheesy stuffed bread is crispy on top, chewy inside and very cheesy, but beware... it's very dangerous. You can get addicted! I fell in love with this particular side from Domino's\u00ae and have been searching for a comparable recipe. After some trial and error I figured out one that is pretty darn close and won't cost me $12 for food, delivery fee, and tip when the craving is overwhelming late at night and my toddler is fast asleep. Serve with marinara sauce.",
