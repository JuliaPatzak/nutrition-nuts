    "summary": "This is a great way to dress up an inexpensive fish and is reminiscent of a Tunisian-style fish preparation. Fried catfish is simmered in a tomato-based sauce with anise seed, chopped fresh lemon, and olives, and served over rice or couscous. You may substitute any other fish if desired. This simple preparation makes it the 'cat's meow'!",
