    "summary": "No, I am not making this up! This is a very old Irish recipe for lobster. Somehow the idea of boiling your lawyer (lobster), then flambeeing him before dousing him in cream, is somehow a justice to the world! Not only is the name fun, but it is an excellent recipe which is great when you have a few quid to spare! If I don't want to go to the hassle of cleaning and boiling the shells, I will sometimes just serve this over toast points, or a pasta of some kind. But the shells make a great presentation!",
