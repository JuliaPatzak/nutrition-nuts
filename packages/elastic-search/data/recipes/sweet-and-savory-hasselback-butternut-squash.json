    "summary": "The glaze creates a smoky caramelized topping, and the cranberries and pistachios add tartness and crunch. My 10-year-old walked in as I pulled this from the oven for the first time and announced, 'that's beautiful!' It's just as amazing in flavor, and it makes a gorgeous, elegant side.",
