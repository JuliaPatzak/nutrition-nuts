    "summary": "Chupe is a traditional Peruvian chowder made from zapallo and seafood. Zapallo is a very large, pumpkin-like squash; however, it is brighter and sweeter than a regular pumpkin. Because it is not widely available I've substituted a butternut squash which comes close in sweetness and texture. Some recipes call for cream cheese but I prefer feta, as it balances out the sweetness of the squash very nicely.",
