    "summary": "Can be used for a party dip for pretzels or a side salad depending on your choice. I usually double this recipe for parties. If you want to use for a dip for pretzels, one batch should be enough. I recommend crushing the pretzels using a rolling pin. I recommend not to add pretzel mixture to pineapple mixture until ready to serve.",
