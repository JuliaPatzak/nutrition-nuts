    "summary": "This is my take on Norwegian flatbread. Without really knowing what I was doing, these came out delightfully tender, supple, almost fabric-like in texture, and tasting deliciously like something between a crepe and a potato pancake. They're traditionally served with butter and a sprinkle of sugar, but I also enjoy them with some smoked salmon, sour cream, and fresh dill. My other favorite topping combo is butter and some kind of berry jam and sour cream.",

    "ingredients": [
        "1 large russet potato",
        "1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons unsalted butter",
        "1 teaspoon salt, or to taste",
        "1 teaspoon white sugar",
        "\u00bc cup heavy cream",
        "1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Line an oven-safe skillet or baking pan with aluminum foil",
        "Poke the potato skin all over with a knife and place on the prepared pan",
        "Roast in the preheated oven until very tender and easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour",
        "Let sit until cool enough to handle but still very warm",
        "Scoop potato flesh out into a bowl",
        "Mash smooth with the back of a spatula until there are no lumps left",
        "You can also use a potato ricer",
        "Add the butter and mix until it disappears",
        "Add the salt, sugar, and cream; mix until smooth",
        "Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours",
        "Mix in flour in several additions until the dough is able to be kneaded by hand",
        "Add enough flour to form a soft, but not too sticky, dough",
        "You need to be able to roll it out fairly thin without it falling apart",
        "Wrap dough with plastic and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour",
        "Divide dough into 8 portions",
        "Dust each with flour and roll out onto a well-floured kitchen towel to 1/8-inch thick, or thinner",
        "Heat a very lightly buttered nonstick pan over medium-high heat",
        "Cook the lefse in the hot pan, poking the surface lightly with a fork, until golden brown blisters form, 2 to 3 minutes per side",
        "Stack on a plate as they're cooked and keep covered with a towel",
        "Serve warm"
