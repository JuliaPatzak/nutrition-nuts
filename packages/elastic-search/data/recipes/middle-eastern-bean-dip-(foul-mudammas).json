    "summary": "My best friend is Syrian and taught me to make this. It is often eaten for breakfast, but I like to make it for dinner. It is vegan and great for fasting periods. If you cannot find fava beans, check a middle eastern market. Add more lemon juice if you like it bitter! Serve with pita bread. It's also great with Kalamata olives, feta cheese, and lemon wedges.",
