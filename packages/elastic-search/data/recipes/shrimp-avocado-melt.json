    "summary": "This is Mexican quesadilla-inspired recipe, with a twist. I also saute whole unsalted cashews with the dish. It's quite decadent! I make this on days when I have sufficiently exercised to offset the calories! It's great as a low-carb dish, if you are not counting calories or fat! I count everything, so I make sure this is a special treat item.",
