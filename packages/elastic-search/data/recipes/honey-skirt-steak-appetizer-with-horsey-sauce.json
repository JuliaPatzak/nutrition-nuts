    "summary": "Every time I serve this, I get phone calls asking for the recipe. So here is the secret to my famous Honey Skirt Steak for all of those that have asked. Told you it is easy! A great before-dinner treat or side dish. If done right, this will blow your socks off. The skirt will have a honey glaze complemented with a nice horseradish sauce. Very easy, very fast, and a load of complements to follows. Horsey Sauce is to your preferred taste. I prefer to cut the horseradish with mayo instead of sour cream - I like a sharper flavor to my sauce. Sour cream could be used, of course.",

    "directions": [
        "Pound skirt steak briefly on each side with the textured side of a meat mallet",

        "Fold bottom of the parchment paper up over the steak; flip steak over and peel the parchment paper from the unseasoned side of steak",
        "Repeat seasoning with remaining 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 more tablespoon honey",

        "Preheat outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate",
