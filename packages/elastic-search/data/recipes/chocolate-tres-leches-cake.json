    "summary": "A chocolate version of a Mexican classic. This moist and delicious cake tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen but a boxed mix makes it so easy! For variety, you can add one tablespoon coffee-flavored liquor (such as Kahlua\u00ae) to your milk mixture or a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to your cake batter.",

        "Beat cake mix, chocolate milk, canola oil, eggs, and espresso powder together in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on a low speed until dry ingredients are moistened",
        "Increase speed to medium and continue beating another 2 minutes; pour into prepared pan",

        "Remove cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan until it is no longer hot to the touch",

        "Spread chocolate whipped cream on the cake to serve"
