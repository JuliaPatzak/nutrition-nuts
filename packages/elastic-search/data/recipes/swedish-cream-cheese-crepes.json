    "summary": "I call these Swedish crepes because I use a Swedish pancake instead of a regular crepe. My entire family loves these. I have to make a huge batch every time I make these. These also refrigerate very well for 2 to 3 days. Sprinkle crepes with powdered sugar before topping with berries, if you wish.",
