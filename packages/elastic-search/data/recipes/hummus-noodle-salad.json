    "summary": "This noodle salad can be served cold, as it was originally intended, or hot. I prefer it hot. This is a vegetarian recipe, but even for meat eaters it is beautiful. It is very versatile; you can easily adjust it to your preferences, adding complementary flavors and ingredients. It is also wonderful as is.",
