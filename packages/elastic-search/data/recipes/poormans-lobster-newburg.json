    "summary": "This is a superb entree that won't break the bank and is so easy to prepare. Your guests will love it. I usually use monkfish, which has a lobster-like flavor but you can use any white meaty fish, even tilapia. It takes about 30 minutes from start to finish. Serve with your favorite white wine, rice pilaf, and roasted asparagus.",
