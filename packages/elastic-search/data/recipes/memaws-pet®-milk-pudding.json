    "summary": "This is my mom's Memaw's Pet\u00ae Milk Pudding recipe, only done right if cooked on the stove top. I'll always remember her through her recipes more than her pictures. This recipe is great on cold nights, dressed up with cinnamon. A really great comfort food-I've seen and felt it work! I'm Southern and firmly believe in comfort foods. This pudding is great for holidays, but it is also a really special treat my mom would make on really cold nights, or when she was feeling nostalgic about her grandmother. I hope someone tries it and loves it as much as my family does! We pour a lot of heart into it, too. It always has that extra special feeling to it, because we always make it to share with each other.",
