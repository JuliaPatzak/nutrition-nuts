    "summary": "This corn bread is a little on the sweet side. It's made with white cornmeal, but yellow works too. I learned to make it from my other mom (MIL). It is baked in a cast-iron skillet. Can be used to make stuffing or put leftovers in a cup with milk and put it in the fridge overnight for a comforting breakfast.",
