    "summary": "This is my grandma's lumpia and pancit that she has been making since before the family moved to the U.S. when my dad was a child. This is very popular with both family and friends. As soon as my friends in high school discovered my grandma was in town, my house became THE place for lunch! She serves her lumpia with a garlic and vinegar dipping sauce.  It's very pungent, but oh so tasty. You can make a large batch of the lumpia and freeze it, so you can fry up some when ever you crave it! Spring roll wrappers are the best to use, they are thinner and lighter than egg roll wrappers.",
