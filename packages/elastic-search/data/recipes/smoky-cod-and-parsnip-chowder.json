    "summary": "A wonderful New England creation, merging the sweetness of parsnips with a smoky cod broth.  Good fish alternatives include haddock, pollack, cusk, or whiting.  Smoked haddock and smoked pollack are good substitutes for the smoked cod.  Use 1 1/2 pounds fresh cod alone if no lightly smoked fish is available.  Great on cool Autumn evenings!  Serve with hot, crusty bread and garnish with fresh chives.",
