    "summary": "In a recent trip to San Francisco, my brother and I frequented a restaurant in the Haight district for breakfast. The inspiration for this came from that trip. Very simple. Use as a side, a topping (for eggs and omelets) or an ingredient. It's great with Egg Beaters\u00ae omelets. Hope you enjoy.",
