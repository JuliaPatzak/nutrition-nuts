    "summary": "These fragrant, rose-scented, Persian-style marzipan sweets are part of the Sofreh Haft Seen - the traditional Nowruz (Iranian New Year) display. \"Tut\" is the Farsi word for mulberries and these sweets are traditionally shaped like mulberries, but in our house we sometimes go rogue and shape them like bunnies! They are simple to prepare and a fun job for the kids. Enjoy tut with a cup of tea.",
