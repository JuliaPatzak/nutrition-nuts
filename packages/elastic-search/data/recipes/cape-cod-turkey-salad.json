    "summary": "Every year when we visit friends on Cape Cod we celebrate Thanksgiving in July. I incorporated some of the fresh herbs from my friend's garden and came up with this recipe as a way to use up leftover turkey. Serve the salad on croissants, crusty rolls, or a bed of lettuce. A lighter version can be made using reduced fat mayonnaise and sour cream.",
