    "summary": "An authentic Mexican salsa made with tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos. Serve with tacos, nachos, tortilla chips, black beans, refried beans, or fajitas or use as an ingredient in many Mexican recipes. My family uses it as a side in which to dip grilled steak. If you like it hot, then this is for you; this pico is not for the faint of heart. It is very hot, which most people in my circle like. If you don't like highly spicy dishes, you might might want to try something less spicy or cut down the jalapeno and use a type pepper that is more to your taste.",
