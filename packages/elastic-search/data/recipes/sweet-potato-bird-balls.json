    "summary": "These are an excellent staple to have; when you need a quick treat, just defrost a few of these balls. Aside from softening the sweet potato in the microwave, this recipe does not require you to do any cooking at all. It's a relatively simple recipe you can make that will provide with a big batch of treats that freeze well. The fresh fruits and/or vegetables are especially nutritious for your bird, and the cereal give the balls a pleasant crunch.",
