    "summary": "I was headed to a Mardi Gras party and needed to throw something together fast. I had some raw peanuts on hand and decided to try candy coating them with a kick of Cajun seasonings added in. This is the result and they were a hit. 'Addictive' was the word most people used. Would be a great gift to give out during the holidays.",
