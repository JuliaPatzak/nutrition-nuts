    "summary": "This is a fun dip that is both sweet and spicy. I got the recipe by varying other cranberry salsa and dip recipes I have found. I got the idea of the fusion of oil from a friend. There are many ideas for use and a great item to take along when you want to surprise your friends with something they probably have not tried. Serve with Triscuits\u00ae, pita chips, or crackers.",
