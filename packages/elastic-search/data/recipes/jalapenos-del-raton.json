    "summary": "My dad made these grilled poppers and I begged for the recipe. Now everyone begs me for the recipe. They are stuffed with cream cheese and sausage, wrapped in turkey bacon, and grilled--the perfect balance of flavors, and not always super spicy. The spiciness depends on the peppers. I find that the smaller they are, the hotter they are.",
