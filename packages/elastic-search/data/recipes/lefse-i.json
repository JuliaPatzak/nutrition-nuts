    "summary": "A special Scandinavian treat. Beginner lefse makers might want to make only a third of the portion the first time through!  Serve any number of ways. A favorite is with butter or margarine and sugar. Some people like cinnamon with this, too. Jellies make an excellent topping as do thinly sliced fried sandwich meat.",
