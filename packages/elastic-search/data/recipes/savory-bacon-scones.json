    "summary": "I've been trying a variety of scones lately at the local cafes but they're usually sweet. I decided to develop a recipe for a savory scone that I think fits the bill nicely. This version makes eight small (2 1/2-inch in diameter) hemispheres with a bacon center in each. The recipe as written requires that you cool the bacon grease so it's helpful to cook and cut the bacon the day before and finish the scones the next day. I like to minimize the kitchen mess so I've optimized the dough-related work to be in the bowl rather than on the countertop.",
