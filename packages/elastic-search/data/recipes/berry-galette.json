    "summary": "Nothing says summer like fresh berries baked up into a juicy dessert! Galettes are easier than pies, and I love the rustic look. I used raspberries and blueberries in this galette, but it works with a mix of any berries, or just one kind. Make sure you have ice cream or whipped cream to top it with!",
