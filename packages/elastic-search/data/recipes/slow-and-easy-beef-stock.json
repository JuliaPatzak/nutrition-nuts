    "summary": "This simple way of making a beef reduction takes two days, but requires very little work. We buy a hind quarter of beef every 2 months. I use this recipe to make use of the leftover bones from the leg section. I don't add any vegetables or spices with this because I want to be able to control the flavor of sauce I want later. This simply creates a good starting point for a sauce.",
