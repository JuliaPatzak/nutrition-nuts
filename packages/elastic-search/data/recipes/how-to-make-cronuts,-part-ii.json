    "ingredients": [
        "6 cups grapeseed oil for frying, or as needed",
        "1 cup confectioners' sugar",
        "1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons milk, or as needed",
        "\u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Once dough has been made, cut, and dough has risen (see How to Make Cronuts, Part I), continue on to fry and glaze your homemade cronuts",
        "Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a deep saucepan over medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Carefully lift a cronut and gently drop into oil",
        "Fry 2 at a time until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side",
        "Cronuts will puff up as they cook",
        "Drain on racks over paper towels; let cool",
        "Whisk confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a shallow bowl until glaze is smooth and slightly runny",
        "Pick up a fried cronut and gently dip the top in glaze; return to rack and let stand until glaze has set, about 15 minutes",
        "Alternate version: For higher-rising cronuts, roll out finished dough (see Part I) into an 8x12 inch rectangle",
        "Fold dough in thirds and roll out into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick",
        "Cut out 6 cronuts and holes, using a 3-inch round cutter and a 1-inch small hole cutter",
        "Line baking sheet with waxed paper and dust paper lightly with flour",
        "Place cronuts and holes onto prepared baking sheet and let rise in a draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour",
        "Carefully pick up and gently drop cronuts, 2 at a time, into the preheated oil",
        "Fry 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side",
        "The extra fold and making the dough thicker will result in taller cronuts than before",
        "Let fried cronuts drain on racks",
        "Dip tops of cronuts in glaze as described above, and let cool on racks to let glaze set up"
