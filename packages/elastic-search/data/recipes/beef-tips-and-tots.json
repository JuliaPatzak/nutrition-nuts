    "summary": "I'm going to show you this very old-school method of making beef tips, which, once made, can be used to top lots of things--but my favorite thing to top with tips is probably Tater Tots\u00ae. And if you're looking for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, this is one of my all-time favorite methods. You can give this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of tots, if you like.",
