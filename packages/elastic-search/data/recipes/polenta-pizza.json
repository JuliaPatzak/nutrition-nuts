    "summary": "When we had our restaurant, one of our specials on Thursday night was polenta and chicken. We always had polenta left over and Dad would complain about the waste. I came up with this idea and boy did it take off! Johnny would grill a slice of polenta on the grill and then add sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions and then top it with a little sauce and mozzarella.",
