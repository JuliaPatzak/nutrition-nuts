        "Combine Honeycrisp apples, Granny Smith apples, and apple cider in a large stainless steel or enamel-coated saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until mixture reduces by about half, about 20 minutes",
        "Stir sugar and lemon juice into the apple mixture; bring to a boil",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking at a simmer until the mixture is very thick, about 25 minutes",
        "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes",
        "Pack apple butter into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top",
        "Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles",
        "Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue",
        "Top with lids and screw on rings",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water",
        "Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder",
        "Leave a 2-inch space between the jars",
        "Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars",
        "Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes",
        "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool",
        "Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)",
