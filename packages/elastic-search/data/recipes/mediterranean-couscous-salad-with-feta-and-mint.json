    "summary": "I created this Mediterranean salad to pair with a white-blend wine from South Africa. The saltiness of the feta and the freshness of the mint and vegetables made a perfect accompaniment to the citrus and herb notes of the wine. I cut up and dressed the vegetables the night before and then the morning that I was serving the salad, I cooked up the couscous following the directions on the package then tossed it with the vegetables and feta.",
