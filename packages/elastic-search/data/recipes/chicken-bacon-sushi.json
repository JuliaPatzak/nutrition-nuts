    "summary": "I saw this bacon sushi idea online somewhere, but I did not save it, so I had to wing it from memory and kept it as simple as possible. I made it for the March Madness final and the whole family loved it! I made it in the toaster oven on convection at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and kept a close eye on it.",

    "ingredients": [
        "1 pound bacon slices",
        "1 pound ground chicken",
        "1 tablespoon barbeque chicken seasoning",
        "3 slices Havarti cheese"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Measure out a 20-inch square piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet",
        "Lay out slices of bacon side-by-side, overlapping slightly, to create an even layer on the parchment paper",
        "Combine ground chicken with barbeque seasoning; spread evenly onto the bacon layer from edge to edge",
        "Place Havarti cheese slices lengthwise on top",
        "Lift the parchment paper to help you roll a log, starting with the edge of bacon closest to you",
        "Bake in the preheated oven, rotating baking sheet every 15 minutes, until bacon is crispy and chicken is cooked through; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour",
        "Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes",
        "Slice into bite-sized \"sushi\""
