    "summary": "This recipe is adapted from the Omanhene brownie recipe. Omanhene is Ghanaian chocolate so that's where the 'Ghana' comes in. The original recipe uses refined, white sugar - but I replaced that with light brown plus demerara/turbinado sugar - as well as substituting butter for canola oil and whole eggs for just whites. The end result is a brownie with a strong come-on and a very bad attitude. Bake with caution!",
