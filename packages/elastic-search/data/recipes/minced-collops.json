    "summary": "A delicious way to stretch ground beef. This is a traditional Scottish recipe. It's quick and very easy, and my family loves it with mashed potatoes. The combination of beef and oatmeal sounds really weird at first, I know, but it is delicious. Steel-cut oats can be a bit pricey, but one tin will last a long, long time. Leftovers of this are wonderful. I've made sandwiches with it; I've filled tortillas with it; I've wrapped it in puff pastry and made little pies. It's very easy and it's very good! I hope your family likes it as much as mine does.",
