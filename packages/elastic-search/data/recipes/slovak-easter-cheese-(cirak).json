        "4 cups milk",
        "12  eggs",
        "1 teaspoon salt"

    "directions": [
        "Measure milk into a bowl, and set over a saucepan filled half way with simmering water",
        "Heat until warm to the touch, then gradually start cracking eggs into the milk while stirring almost constantly",
        "This will scorch very easily",
        "Continue to stir slowly once all of the eggs are in, until the mixture resembles scrambled eggs",
        "Pour into a cheesecloth bag and tie tightly",
        "Hang from the sink faucet or over a bowl and allow to drain for 1 to 2 hours",
        "Place on a cooling rack set over a pan or bowl and set a heavy object on top to press out the liquid",
        "A cool cast iron skillet weighted with heavy cans works well",
        "Press for about 2 hours",
        "Carefully remove the weights and cheesecloth bag from the cheese",
        "Refrigerate the cheese for several hours or overnight before slicing and serving"
