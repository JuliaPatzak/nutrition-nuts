    "summary": "I wanted to use my mochiko flour and found this recipe online from the Honolulu advisor. I tweaked it by adding less sugar and skipping the coconut and it turned out so well.  It's like mochi but more cake-y or like a cake but chewy. Definitely will make again! Tastes even better the next day.",
