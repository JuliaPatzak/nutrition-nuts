    "summary": "Now for something completely different, how about a little Caribbean/Creole feel? This can be done with fish or with scallops and will wake up the little taste buds. Please forgive me, I am not a real recipe follower, and I change it around all the time. Hope this works for you, love to hear about it. I never wrote it as a recipe, sort of a seat of the pants guy. One item to complete it that I may add is Zatarain's Caribbean Rice\u00ae,  and in this I add 1/2 red bell pepper and 1/4 cup of fresh pineapple.",
