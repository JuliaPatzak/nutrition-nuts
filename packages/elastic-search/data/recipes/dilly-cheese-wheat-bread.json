    "summary": "This bread machine recipe turns out a perfectly textured flavorful bread every time. I prefer to let the bread machine cycle thru 2nd rise, then shape the loaf and bake in the oven at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes. The dill cheese combination is great toasted and makes wonderful salad croutons.",
