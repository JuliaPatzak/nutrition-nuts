    "summary": "Kristen is right, her mom's zucchini bread recipe is great! We gave it a healthier spin by reducing the sugar, increasing the nuts, and adding a bit of buckwheat flour. Buckwheat flour is very nutritious: it contains the 8 amino acids, is high in lysine, and is a good source of B vitamins and iron - and it's gluten-free!",
