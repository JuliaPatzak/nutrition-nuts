    "summary": "This is not a thick soup, yet it is creamy and so smooth to the palette. The aroma when cooking makes you want some before the potatoes are soft. I have made modifications due to allergy to corn (such as rice flour). I allow mine to slow-simmer with lid slightly ajar. Stir often so the film does not form on top. I have doubled my batch and still never have any for the freezer.",
