    "summary": "Until now if you wanted lasagna, you had to make a lot, but thanks to this easy technique, that's all changed. This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas, but you easily scale back and just make one, freezing the extra 3 pancakes for later use! The pancakes in this recipe are actually more like thick crepes that come out tasting like egg noodles. It's almost impossible to tell you didn't use pasta--since these pancakes taste like homemade lasagna noodles. Make it as-is or adapt it to your personal taste.",

        "Brush oil into a nonstick skillet and set heat to medium",
        "When the skillet is hot, add about 1/4 cup batter and tilt the pan so it evenly coats the bottom",

        "Prepare lasagnas: Spread 2 tablespoons marinara sauce into the bottom of each baking dish",
        "Lay 1 pancake triangle on the sauce, then top with about 2 tablespoons ricotta filling, 1 tablespoon Monterey Jack cheese, and 2 teaspoons marinara",
        "Repeat to create another layer, slightly pressing down on the second pancake triangle before topping with filling and cheese",
        "Top with the remaining pancake triangle, pressing down slightly",
        "Add remaining marinara and Monterey Jack, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil",
