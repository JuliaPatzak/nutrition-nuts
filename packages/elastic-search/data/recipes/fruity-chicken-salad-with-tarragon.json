    "summary": "Chicken salad often finds its way to my summer menus, served on greens or a croissant. I think this one is just a little special. It's sweet and juicy from the apples and grapes, a little savory from the tarragon, crunchy from the pecans and celery, and lightened up a bit with some yogurt.",
