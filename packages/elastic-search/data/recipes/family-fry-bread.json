    "summary": "Each tribe has their own recipe for fry bread. This is a recipe that I came across as a teenage girl while staying at my great-grandma's house. Grandma was Native American, and I found that this recipe creates a delicious fry bread for Indian tacos. Fry bread is commonly used for making Indian tacos, but is also good with honey butter or cinnamon-sugar and butter for a dessert. Warm milk can be substituted for the water.",
