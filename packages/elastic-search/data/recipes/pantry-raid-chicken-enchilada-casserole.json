    "summary": "I made this recipe up one night when I had no idea what to do with a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins. It came out so well that my husband and I finished off the leftovers the next day and we are not usually leftover eaters. I am gluten-free so I used gluten-free cornbread mix. You will definitely enjoy it!",
