    "summary": "Incredibly easy to make and crowd-pleasing! Originally served on fresh-caught salmon when visiting relatives in Seattle, Washington. Serve your beautifully colored salmon dish with a fabulous wilted bibb lettuce salad and pair with a Pinot Gris, 'Salmon's Best Wine Friend.' The texture and acidity of Pinot Gris is the perfect balance for salmon and other meaty fish. For dessert, fresh peach parfaits with peach brandy, brown sugar and vanilla bean ice cream.",
