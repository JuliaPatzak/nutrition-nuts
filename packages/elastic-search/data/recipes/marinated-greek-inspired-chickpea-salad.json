    "summary": "This salad gets even better the longer it marinates in the refrigerator. While it's completely yummy right away, it tastes best after about 8 hours. I made up this salad after having early spring cravings for crunchy, crisp, refreshing summer food. The tangy vinaigrette and the sharp feta cheese balance perfectly with the hearty chickpeas and crunchy, sweet veggies and make for a really vibrant and satisfying salad. It is delicious alongside pickled baby beets or grilled chicken too. You can also put it in a wrap, or you can use it as a dip--sort of like a Greek salsa.",
