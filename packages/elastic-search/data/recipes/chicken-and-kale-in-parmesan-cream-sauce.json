    "summary": "One of the vendors at the local farmers market was having a special on end-of-harvest kale. I figured it would go well with chicken and stumbled into this. The sauce is pretty heavy, and the kale and vinegar give it a good tangy flavor. My wife is allergic to garlic, otherwise I would have used 1/2 teaspoon of it instead of the salt. Serve over noodles or spaghetti.",
