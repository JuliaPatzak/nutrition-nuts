    "summary": "Are you sick 'n' tired of dried-out, tough pork chops? I was until I came up with this recipe. The trick to cooking meat and poultry is to know your internal temperatures. That is why you should invest in an instant-read, digital meat thermometer. I will NOT cook without one. And another thing people don't\u00a0realize is that today's pork does NOT have to cook till it gets to 160 to 170 degrees F internal temperature. I like to serve these with some garlic smashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.",
