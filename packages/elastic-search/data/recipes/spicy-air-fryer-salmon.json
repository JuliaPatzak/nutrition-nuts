    "summary": "This air-fried salmon invokes a spicy yet sweet seasoning. The more seasoning you add to the salmon the spicier it will be, so I recommend starting with 2 teaspoons of seasoning per salmon fillet. You may use less salmon if desired. If you use the full amount you will need to cook in batches. You may have extra seasoning leftover, which can be stored in a jar and kept in a cool, dark place.",
