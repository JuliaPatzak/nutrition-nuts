    "summary": "This easy side dish has loads of Parmesan flavor, yet it tastes light enough to not overpower the asparagus. The sauce comes together in minutes while the asparagus roasts in the oven. Quick enough for a busy weeknight meal. Use freshly shredded Parmesan cheese, as the bagged variety doesn't melt well.",
