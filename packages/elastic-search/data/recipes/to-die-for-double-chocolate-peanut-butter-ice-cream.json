    "summary": "I couldn't find any recipes for chocolate peanut butter ice cream on this site, so I made one up. This is amazingly delicious--trust me on this. After tasting this, you'll have a difficult time justifying a store bought ice cream purchase. You can leave out the peanut butter and have heavenly double chocolate ice cream, yum! If you like your ice cream on the sweeter side, you can add an additional 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of sugar. Personally, I think the ice cream is sweet enough with 1/2 cup.",
