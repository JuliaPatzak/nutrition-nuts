    "summary": "Different regions of the country have differences in cooking gumbo. In Charleston, gumbo is at its best during the shrimping season because Charleston gumbo depends more on the catch of the day as well as the produce in season. Gumbo in Charleston is slow cooked with much attention being paid to the sauce. We thicken the gumbo with a roux of flour and water, not file as in Louisiana-style gumbo, because this is not native to SC. In Charleston, gumbo is put over rice for a complete meal. Now that's Geechee! Serve over white rice or with cornbread if desired.",
