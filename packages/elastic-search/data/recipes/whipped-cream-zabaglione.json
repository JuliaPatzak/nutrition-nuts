    "summary": "This zabaglione is different because it incorporates cream. I have viewed other recipes and this varies a lot. Serve chilled with fresh fruit of your choice. To make sure zabaglione is the right consistency, run the whisk through and see that it falls in a steady stream standing on itself as it lands in the bowl.",
