    "summary": "This is a super-easy way someone taught me to make homemade yogurt that requires only 2 ingredients. Pay attention to the notes. Halve the recipe if this is your first time. Usually because store-bought yogurts have lots of additives first-time yogurts do not turn out perfectly. But save 1 cup and use it as base the next time and you will see how well it turns out.",

        "Put the lid on the pot and carefully wrap a blanket around it",
        "Place the wrapped pot in a slightly warm place where it will be undisturbed for 6 to 10 hours; overnight is best",
