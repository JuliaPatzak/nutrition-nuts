    "summary": "This recipe replaces the butter on traditional garlic bread with cream cheese, making it creamy and delicious! The blue cheese adds a sophisticated flair and pairs especially well with a nice grilled steak and green salad. This bread cooks up crisp on the outside while the topping keeps the inside moist and soft.",
