    "summary": "Serve this lemony goat cheese salad as a side dish or as a meal with crunchy walnuts and tender butterhead lettuce. Each tangy-fresh salad offers fewer than 200 calories. Wrapping aluminum foil around each beet for roasting creates a small steam chamber to cook each vegetable. In addition to locking in nutrients and flavor, the aluminum foil-wrapped beets cook without getting dry.",
