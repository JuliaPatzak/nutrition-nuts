    "summary": "These muffins are delicious -- they are my uncle's recipe. Since I was born until I was ten or eleven I would have one of these muffins with breakfast every morning. They have just the perfect amount of everything, light and sweet. Then I learned to bake them myself and have been ever since. It's also a good way to use up bananas that are somewhat past their best days.",
