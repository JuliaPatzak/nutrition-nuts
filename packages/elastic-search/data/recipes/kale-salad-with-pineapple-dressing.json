    "summary": "This is our favorite, healthiest treat! Even the kids love it. You can let this sit overnight to help soften the kale, or you can massage it as you toss it. You can add nuts, fruit, or freeze-dried fruit if you wish, but be sure to add any freeze-dried fruit last or it will lose its crunch.",
