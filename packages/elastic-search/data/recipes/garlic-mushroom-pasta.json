    "summary": "My mom used to make this for me as a kid. It is easy to whip up and can be modified. Change the veggies, add some bacon, use less garlic, whatever. Sometimes I've used one egg and stirred in some margarine (or butter or olive oil) but I like it best like this. This is sized as smaller servings, almost as a side dish size.",
