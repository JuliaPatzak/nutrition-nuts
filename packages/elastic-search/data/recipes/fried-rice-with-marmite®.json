    "summary": "My nanny made this for me as a child growing up in Malaysia and I learnt to cook it and it's been my favorite fried rice dish EVER! I'm a student and so I make this dish a lot simply because it barely takes any effort at all. I have many Marmite\u00ae hater friends who absolutely despise the thought of Marmite\u00ae and even they love it because once it is combined with the rice and other ingredients, it is extremely fragrant and it doesn't even taste strongly of Marmite\u00ae at all! Adventurous food fanatics, I assure you that this is a winner!",
