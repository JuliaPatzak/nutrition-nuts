    "summary": "This recipe has been altered and tweaked with each batch until I felt it couldn't suit us any better. I used to remove the bones and skin, which was time consuming, but found after smashing everything the bones are not noticed and the skin adds flavor! This is quick and easy and flavorful enough for the toddler in my house. Grilling these salmon patties is a healthy alternative to beef burgers. Serve alone, on a bun, or on a bed of fresh greens.",
