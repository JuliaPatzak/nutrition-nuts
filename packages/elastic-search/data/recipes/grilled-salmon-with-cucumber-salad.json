    "summary": "Cucumber salad perfectly accompanies a piece of grilled salmon. Salting and draining the cucumbers first intensifies their flavor and makes the salad less watery. Once the cucumbers have released some of their moisture, pat them dry on paper towels and dress them with sour cream, vinegar and dill. If you're not a dill fan, feel free to substitute basil or parsley, fresh or dried.",
