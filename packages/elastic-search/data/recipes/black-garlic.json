    "summary": "Black garlic has been around for many, many years. It is regular garlic that has been fermented. It is soft and savory yet very sweet. It is high in antioxidants and has many health benefits. It is used in both sweet and savory dishes and absolutely delicious eaten on its own. I prefer to use the solo garlic bulbs (aka single clove garlic which are easily found in most Asian markets), but regular garlic can also be used.",
