    "summary": "Water roux is a mixture of flour and water that gives bread/buns a softer texture. The formula was introduced by a Japanese chef, with the ratio of 1 part flour to 5 parts water, heated up to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) to encourage the gelatinization of starch. With this bread-making technique popular in Asia, the bread is soft, springy and stays fresh a long time.",
