    "summary": "Rib tips are the parts of the rib that are cut away to make St. Louis ribs. Some butchers call this the pork brisket. This cut has a lot of cartilage, but a low, slow cook softens the cartilage and makes it tasty. I like to cut them into small pieces. These meaty bits are a little easier to manage than ribs, and their meaty, chewy texture makes a great appetizer or a main dish. Serve with additional barbecue sauce, if desired.",
