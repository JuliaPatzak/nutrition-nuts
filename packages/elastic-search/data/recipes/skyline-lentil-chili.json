    "summary": "Serve chili over spaghetti and top with chopped onion, finely shredded Cheddar cheese, kidney beans, and Tabasco\u00ae sauce. I used to love Skyline Cincinnati-style chili. When I went vegetarian I came up with this Skyline lentil chili to give me that Skyline taste. I use green or black lentils as the protein where standard Cincinnati-style would use ground meat. Even though I've gone back to eating meat this is still my preferred way to get my Skyline fix.",
