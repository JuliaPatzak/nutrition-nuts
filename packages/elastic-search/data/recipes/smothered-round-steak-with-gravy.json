    "summary": "This is one of the first recipes I learned to cook when I was a teenager. Mom taught me to cook over the phone, after I got home from school every day. She was working and I didn't think about it at the time, but later I realized my calls were reassuring to her, since she knew I was safely home. Even when Mom told me how to do it, I nearly always tweaked it! Most of the time, it turned out okay. Mashed potatoes and biscuits are perfect with this, along with a vegetable.",
