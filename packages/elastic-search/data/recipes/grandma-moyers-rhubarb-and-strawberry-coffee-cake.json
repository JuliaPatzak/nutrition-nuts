    "summary": "This was my Grandma Moyer's recipe. It has been missing since at least the mid 80's. I found it stuck the middle of an old book I got after my mom passed away. Everyone in the family has been trying to recreate this delicious coffee cake for years. It is moist and very flavorful. I added the strawberries because I like it a little sweeter. Rhubarb is an ingredient that you don't see used very often any more, but those of us who do use it always love to find new ways to spread the love.",
