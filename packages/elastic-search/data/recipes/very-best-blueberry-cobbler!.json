    "summary": "I've tinkered and tinkered, and this is the very best blueberry cobbler recipe I've found. Cakey/biscuit topping with a slight crunch on top and ooey gooey delicious blueberries hidden on the bottom. It can also work with other fruit fillings. Works best with delicious fresh blueberries and is the perfect summer treat.... An amalgamation of mine and my grandmother's cobbler recipe.... I think it is the best! Serve plain or with whipped cream. Enjoy!",

        "1 tablespoon butter, melted",
        "1\u2009\u00be cups all-purpose flour",

    "directions": [
        "Lightly grease an 8 inch square baking dish",
        "Place the blueberries into the baking dish, and mix with vanilla and lemon juice",
        "Sprinkle with 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of flour, then stir in the tablespoon of melted butter",
        "Set aside",
        "In a medium bowl, stir together 1 3/4 cups of flour, baking powder, and 6 tablespoons sugar",
        "Rub in the 5 tablespoons butter using your fingers, or cut in with a pastry blender until it is in small pieces",
        "Make a well in the center, and quickly stir in the milk",
        "Mix just until moistened",
        "You should have a very thick batter, or very wet dough",
        "You may need to add a splash more milk",
        "Cover, and let batter rest for 10 minutes",
        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Spoon the batter over the blueberries, leaving only a few small holes for the berries to peek through",

        "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden brown",

        "Let cool until just warm before serving",
        "This can store in the refrigerator for 2 days"
