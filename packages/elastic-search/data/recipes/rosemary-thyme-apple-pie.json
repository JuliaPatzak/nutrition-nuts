    "summary": "Rosemary and thyme in apple pie?! That's just crazy enough to work! This pie is exquisitely aromatic, and the herbs really allow the apples to shine. The crust is the result of years of experiments, and it is flaky, buttery, and delicious. This pie has become the most highly requested item for me to bring to parties, and is always devoured immediately with lots of 'oohs,' 'ahhs,' and 'mms.'",
