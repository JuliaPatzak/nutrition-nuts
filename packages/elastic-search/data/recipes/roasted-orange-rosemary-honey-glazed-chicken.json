    "summary": "This is always a hit when I make it for dinner parties and Boxing Day dinner because the chicken is always fall-off-the-bone juicy and people love the glaze. People always go for seconds! You may quarter 2 chickens instead if you aren't able to get just legs from your butcher, but I find the legs are juicier and save money. Serve this dish with fragrant rice and dilled carrots or roasted asparagus.",
