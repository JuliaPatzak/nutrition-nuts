    "summary": "My mom used to make this variation of sloppy joes, which our family preferred. It is not for the health conscious, but it is very good. It can be eaten on bread as sandwiches, or served over rice. Top with sour cream or French onion dip. The French onion dip is good if you want a little more zip to it. It is actually even better the second day.",
