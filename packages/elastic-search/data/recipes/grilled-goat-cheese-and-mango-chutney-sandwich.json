    "summary": "I made this sandwich up one day and have never been able to enjoy traditional grilled cheese quite as much since. The tangy goat cheese and spicy-sweet mango chutney is an awesome combo, and sourdough bread lends to the flavor nicely. As a bonus, it is ridiculously quick and easy to make! Try pairing this with butternut squash soup; it's an even better combo than the old grilled cheese and tomato!",
