    "summary": "Moving around a lot, I find that cities often do not share the same restaurants. I lived in Seattle for a few years, and am now in Pensacola, FL. I missed the Samurai Salmon Wrap from World Wrapps. This is my effort for re-creating this taste sensation. It's a wrap with a fabulous Japanese-Asian flavor and a blend of textures to savor.",
