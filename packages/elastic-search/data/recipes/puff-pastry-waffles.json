    "summary": "Add puff pastry to the list of good things you can snackify in your waffle iron. Although they don't puff up as much as oven-baked puff pastry, they turn out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and they take only minutes to make. Serve hot or at room temperature with syrup, fruit, Nutella\u00ae, fruit preserves, or nut butter.",
