    "summary": "Being on a diet, the words creamy and pasta usually are reserved for only my cheat days. I wanted to make something and not feel guilty about eating it, so I whipped this up in the kitchen. It's delicious and very adaptable; change it up however you like! Has a nice little bite with the red pepper flakes added. This would also be fantastic with onion added.",
