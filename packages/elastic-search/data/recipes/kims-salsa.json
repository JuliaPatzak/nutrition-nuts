    "summary": "This recipe is a favorite of all my friends. Whenever they come over, they want to leave with a jar. Therefore, when I make it I can 14 GALLONS each time. I figure, if I'm gonna spend all day making it, I might as well only do it once a year! I like to serve this salsa with tortillas or use it in cooking. It's great in scrambled eggs and chili.",
