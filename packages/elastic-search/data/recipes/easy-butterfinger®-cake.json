    "summary": "Angel food cake, Butterfinger\u00ae candy bars and Cool Whip\u00ae are the well known favorites in this delightful (and easy) no-bake dessert. Looks great in a trifle bowl. I don't even like Butterfinger\u00ae bars and I thoroughly enjoy this stuff!! You can do this in a 9x13-inch pan as well, but the trifle looks so nice!",
