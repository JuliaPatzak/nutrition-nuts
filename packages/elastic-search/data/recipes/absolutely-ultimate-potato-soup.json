    "summary": "I have made this for many whom have given it the title. This takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe.  (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)",
