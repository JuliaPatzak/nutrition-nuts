    "summary": "It is not always easy to make children eat vegetables. Mine are teenagers now, but they still love this recipe of broccoli and cheese nuggets that I have been making for them since they were little. These delicious broccoli and cheese nuggets are not difficult to prepare and they take little time. This recipe is eaten very well as light lunch, as a side dish, and even as a snack. You can serve it as is, but accompanied with a dip it is even tastier. Here are some examples of dip that go very well with these broccoli and cheese nuggets: ranch dip, Asian dip, sour cream, and salsa.",
