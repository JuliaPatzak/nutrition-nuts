    "summary": "A sweet and savory treat for any get-together that will sure be a crowd pleaser. It's cheap and easy to make in a slow cooker with only three ingredients. I make this for any get-together and it is always a hit! I was a little unsure at first about the grape jelly concoction, but I tried it and have never done it any other way. It is so savory with just enough sweet. I always receive or over hear lots of agreement with the taste of the sauce. It always disappears at parties, and the next day I have cravings for these cocktail wienies. Try it for your next potluck, back yard BBQ, or any event!",
