    "summary": "This is one of my favorite recipes handed down from my mom.  The best thing is there are lots of vegetables and flavors, and it's usually a welcome change from standard  American versions.  The olives are the best part!  To save time, I usually chop all the vegetables and make the dressing while the potatoes are boiling.",
