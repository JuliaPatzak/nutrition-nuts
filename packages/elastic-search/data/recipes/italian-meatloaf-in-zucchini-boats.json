    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",

        "Sprinkle the garlic salt into the hollowed-out zucchini, and set aside",

        "In a mixing bowl, mix the ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs, basil, carrot, and Parmesan cheese together with the onion mixture",

        "Spoon about half the spaghetti sauce over the zucchini, covering all the meat and allowing sauce to drip down the sides of the zucchini boats",
