    "summary": "Cold-brewed coffee poured over coffee ice cubes makes the best iced coffee. It takes a bit of planning, but its full, rich flavor makes the wait worthwhile. The ideal coffee for this cold drink is a blend of mid-roasted beans with moderate acid. Using a dark roast and beans high in acid produces a sharper, more bitter result.",
