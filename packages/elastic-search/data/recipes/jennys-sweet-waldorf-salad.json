    "summary": "I couldn't ever find the perfect Waldorf salad - one that wasn't too mayonaise-y tasting, yet one that still held enough of the original flavor to be called a Waldorf. So I mixed and matched and experimented, and finally came up with a perfect twist on the classic Waldorf Salad recipe. Now I get requests for it at every family get together!",
