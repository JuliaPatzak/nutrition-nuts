    "summary": "Some ladies I know use to make a pimento cheese spread and sell it at the Augusta National Golf Course during Masters week. The only thing I knew about their recipe was that they used bell peppers instead of pimentos. I figured the rest out on my own. My family devours it every time I make it. Serve this with crackers, or spread it on bread for a tasty sandwich.",
