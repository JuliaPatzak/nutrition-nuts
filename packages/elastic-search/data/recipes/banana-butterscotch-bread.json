    "summary": "Warning! Addictive! This is such a delicious version of traditional banana bread and is extremely popular whenever I make it that I had to share it on Allrecipes!  I got it from an old Bed and Breakfast recipe from a place in Maryland and make it every year around the holidays!  I don't use the walnuts, but I hear that it is really good for those that like them.  This recipe has definitely become a new tradition!",
