    "summary": "How can a New Englander love Manhattan over New England clam chowder?  Because I like to taste the clams, not just heavy cream with lumps.  I came up with this recipe today using what I had on hand, but feel free to improvise.  This tastes just like the chowder you get at the beach with clam cakes! When reheating, do not boil or it will 'rubberize' the clams.",
