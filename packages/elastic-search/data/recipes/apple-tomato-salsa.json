    "summary": "This is a fresh salsa that I submitted to an apple cooking contest. I don't like spicy salsas so it's more flavorful than hot, but you can spice it up however you want. I used 'on-the-vine' tomatoes because of their juiciness. I toasted my own tortilla chips in the oven for 3 minutes on each side then cut them size. I didn't want the oil and salt from store bought chips, but try whatever kind of chips you want.",
