    "summary": "One of the hardest foods for me to give up after I became vegan was sushi. Nothing beats fresh spicy tuna, or shrimp tempura crunch rolls. Unfortunately, many vegan sushi restaurant options are bland and filled with nothing but veggies. I'm left rather unsatisfied and still craving the creamy texture of sashimi. I decided to try my hand at making my own veggie rolls. Serve with pickled ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi to enjoy an authentic sushi experience!",
