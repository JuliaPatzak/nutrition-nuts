    "summary": "I love this dessert so much that now my mother makes one for dessert on Christmas and a separate one for me to take home. This pudding is very rich and small servings go a very long way. It's delicious for weeks afterward in the refrigerator. Cut a slice, add brandy sauce, microwave, and indulge while your New Year's resolution is looking the other way!",
