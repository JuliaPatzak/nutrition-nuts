    "summary": "This kale salad with cranberries is called \"circus salad\" in our house because it is so colorful and fun! This is a super wholesome salad with all-natural ingredients and no added oils or sugar. Try using quinoa instead of couscous, add warm asparagus on top, or stir in roasted, diced sweet potatoes and onions for even more color and nutrients. This keeps well for days - I usually make a big batch and have it for lunch through the week.",
