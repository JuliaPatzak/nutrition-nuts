    "summary": "I came up with this tasty swai recipe when I was craving something vaguely Indian, but also wanted to keep it simple and light and use the ingredients I had on hand.  I serve it with white rice and a side of stir-fried Asian veggies such as bok choy with garlic, oyster sauce, and cashews.",
