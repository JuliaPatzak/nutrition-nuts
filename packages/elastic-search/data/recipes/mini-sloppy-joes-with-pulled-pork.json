    "summary": "If you have leftover pulled pork, with no sauce on it, turn it into sloppy Joe-type sandwiches for a twist on hamburger.  Mini Kaiser rolls provide a sturdy, flavorful base for the sandwiches, which can be served alone as an appetizer, or as a main dish when accompanied by your favorite sides. We like fresh corn on the cob and coleslaw.",
