    "directions": [
        "Soak apricots in boiling water in a bowl until hydrated, about 30 minutes",

        "Combine apricot mixture with pectin in a large pot over medium heat; cook until just boiling",
        "Add sugar and lemon juice; boil until sugar has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes",
        "Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes",
        "Pack the apricot jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4-inch of the top",
        "Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles",
        "Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue",
        "Top with lids, and screw on rings",
        "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water",
        "Bring to a boil, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder",
        "Leave a 2-inch space between the jars",
        "Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars",
        "Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes",
        "Remove jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool, about 1 hour",
        "Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)",
        "Store in a cool, dark area"
