    "summary": "My sister inspired me to make a green salsa similar to how you would make one by roasting tomatillos, but using all green tomatoes instead. This is a tangy and fresh tasting salsa using fresh lime juice and cilantro. Change the peppers and spices to your liking! Serve with tortilla chips or as a topping for chicken or fish.",
