    "summary": "Zucchini is not very exciting, interesting, or fun to eat, which is basically the opposite of a taco. But what we're going to do here is use the same filling used to make tacos to stuff zucchini and turn something that's generally unremarkable into something that is incredibly remarkable. This isn't some kind of low-carb substitute gimmick--these really were amazing. Serve topped with diced tomato, green onions, sour cream, and cilantro, or any toppings you prefer.",

    "directions": [
        "Combine olive oil, onion, and ground beef in a skillet over high heat",

        "Add garlic and jalapeno pepper and stir for 2 minutes",
        "Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cumin, dried oregano, cornmeal, and black pepper",

        "Remove from heat and set aside to cool",
        "Use a teaspoon or melon baller to scoop out about half the center of each zucchini to create a \"boat",
        "\" Sprinkle generously with remaining kosher salt and let sit, 15 to 20 minutes",
        "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",

        "Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is browned and the zucchini is just barely tender, about 20 minutes",
