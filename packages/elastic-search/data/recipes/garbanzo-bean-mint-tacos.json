    "summary": "This is a great meal for a summer night! It's light, cool, refreshing, and very easy to make. Your palette will do a little dance! The bean mixture can be used on it's own as a very healthy snack. Home grown tomatoes add a really nice sweetness to the dish! If you use corn tortillas try to find organic ones with a short list of ingredients! My favorite ones only have corn, water, and lime. Eat real food!",
