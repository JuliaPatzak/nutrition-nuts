    "summary": "I've made these pies 4 or 5 times at this point, and I still can't decide if they are merely interesting or the greatest thing ever. I will update this after the 10th making. If you are unfamiliar with pears, read up on them. Usually they need to ripen for several days once they've been purchased from the store.",

        "2 cups finely shredded mild Cheddar cheese",
        "1 cup butter, softened",
        "\u2154 cup white sugar",
        "2 tablespoons cornstarch",

        "Stir grated Cheddar cheese into the flour mixture using a fork",
        "Stir in butter using a wide spoon until mixture becomes crumbly",
        "Set topping mixture aside at room temperature",
        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Place pie crusts in their tins onto a baking sheet to catch drips; place crusts 1 inch apart",
        "Sift sugar, cornstarch, and salt into a small bowl",
        "Place pears in a large mixing bowl",
        "When oven is hot, sprinkle sugar mixture over pears and stir to combine",
        "Pour filling evenly into the 2 pie crusts",
        "Divide topping mixture in half and add to the top of each pie in 4 to 6 dollops; use a wide knife to spread evenly",

        "Bake about 7 minutes more"
