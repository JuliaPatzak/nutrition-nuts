    "summary": "If you are in a hurry to get dinner on the table, these grilled fish sandwiches will be ready in less time than it takes to preheat the grill! To make things even quicker, I used a purchased remoulade sauce, but there are some great recipes for remoulade here on the site. We like simple toppings of lettuce and sliced tomatoes, but feel free to add your favorite sandwich toppings, if you prefer!",
