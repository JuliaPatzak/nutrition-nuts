    "summary": "This is my take on the cilantro-lime quinoa bowl from everyone's favorite Mexican-inspired coastal fast food chain. It turned out pretty good. You can season the tilapia or buy the pre-seasoned ones at the market. If you have an Aldi grocery nearby, they have a fresh tilapia seasoned with a Southwest rub, which is perfect for this recipe.",
