    "summary": "These shrimp fajitas are a great weeknight dish. Quick, easy, and delicious. If you prefer something milder, omit the chipotle peppers - but trust me - they really add some kick! I serve these with black or refried beans on the side. Very yummy. Serve with avocado, sour cream, and shredded Cheddar cheese if you like.",
