    "summary": "A friend of mine makes a similar Southwestern-style soup using sweet potatoes, but I found that processing the potatoes takes a bit of extra work.  I came up with the idea to use canned pumpkin and created this wonderful, thick, hearty soup that doesn't take a lot of effort to make. It's full of all that's good for you, so enjoy!",
