    "summary": "I love chile rellenos, but they can be time consuming to make from scratch. This is a fast fix! Feel free to spoon your favorite ranchera sauce over the top if serving with rice and beans. This recipe comes from my 76-year-old Japanese mother, who learned it from a Filipino lady she used to work with back in the early 80s. If using wonton wrappers, you can serve these as appetizers. Enjoy!",
