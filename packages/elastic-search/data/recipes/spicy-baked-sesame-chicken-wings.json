    "summary": "This is the best/easiest way to cook wings, in my opinion! They are not fried, not greasy, are lower in calories, and oh so yummy! A little spicy, but not too much, and a little smoky from the chipotle and liquid smoke! Obviously bourbon is optional! I prefer the drummies, but my husband likes the whole wing, minus the wing tips. Your choice!",
