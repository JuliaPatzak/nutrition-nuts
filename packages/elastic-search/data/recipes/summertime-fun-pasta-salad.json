    "summary": "A light pasta salad both adults and kids will love. This is my own creation I am sure many have already tried. You can add or take away from this recipe. I usually serve crowds of 10 to 20 people, but I love to entertain so I also always serve this, spinach dip, potato and green salad, chip with dip and wings... This dish is always a hit!",
