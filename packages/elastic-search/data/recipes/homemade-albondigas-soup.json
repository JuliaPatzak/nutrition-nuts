    "summary": "This soup reminds me of when I was young, staying home from school. My grandmother would make this for me. It is so good and flavorful. It is great for a cold rainy day, or any day you feel like it. You can substitute any of the veggies for ones you like better. My grandmother would also make Mexican rice and scoop some into my bowl to make it even better!",
