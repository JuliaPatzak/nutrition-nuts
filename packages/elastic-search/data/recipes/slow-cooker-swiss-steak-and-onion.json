    "summary": "Delicious and easy Swiss steak recipe that will have you out of the kitchen in under 20 minutes. I love to pair this with egg noodles or rice, being sure to get a good spoonful of sauce along with the steak. Feel free to add celery, green pepper, carrots, or your favorite vegetable. My husband isn't a fan of celery or green pepper, so I keep my Swiss steak simple.",
