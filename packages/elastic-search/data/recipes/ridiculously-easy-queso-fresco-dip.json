    "summary": "On a recent trip to the local Costco\u00ae, I ended up purchasing a huge thing of queso fresco, or Mexican white cheese. Not sure what to do with it, I created this modified dip that goes perfectly with any Mexican-themed meal! It's so ridiculously easy, and looks much more refined than classic chile con queso. Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy! Reheat as needed.",
