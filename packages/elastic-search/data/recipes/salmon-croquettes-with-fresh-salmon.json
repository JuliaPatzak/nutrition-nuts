        "1 pound boneless, skinless salmon fillets",
        "\u00bd cup baking mix (such as Bisquick\u00ae)",
        "\u00bd cup diced onion",
        "\u00bc cup diced red bell pepper",
        "\u00bc cup freshly chopped parsley",
        "1 large egg",
        "3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "\u00bd teaspoon Worcestershire sauce",
        "\u00bc teaspoon seasoned salt",
        "\u00bc teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay\u00ae)",
        "\u2153 cup cornmeal",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"

    "directions": [
        "Finely chop the salmon using a food processor",
        "Transfer salmon to a bowl with baking mix, onion, bell pepper, parsley, egg, garlic, Worcestershire, seasoned salt, and seafood seasoning",
        "Mix until the ingredients are well blended",
        "Form the mixture into 8 small patties, and place onto a plate lined with waxed paper",
        "If you are struggling to form the patties due to the mixture being sticky, rinse your hands after forming every few patties, as the mixture is easier to work with while your hands are clean",
        "Refrigerate the patties for 30 minutes",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat",
        "Place the cornmeal into a shallow dish and dredge each patty in the cornmeal, pressing lightly so that the cornmeal adheres to both sides of the patties",
        "Working in batches, cook the patties in the oil until golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side"
