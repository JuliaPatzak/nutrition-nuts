    "summary": "I love boiled peanuts but in the past they've been a bit of hassle to make. They've got to be soaked in water overnight, then you have to wait for the giant pot of water to boil, the water evaporates so you have to add more water every hour, and then every time you do that you have to wait for the water to start boiling again. I knew there had to be a way to simplify the process and the Instant Pot\u00ae is the solution. While they still take time, the method is hands-off and they are still done quicker than the 8 hours alone it takes to soak them overnight using the stovetop method.",
