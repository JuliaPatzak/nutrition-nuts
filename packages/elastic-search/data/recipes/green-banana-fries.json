    "summary": "I learned about this when I was in Kenya. I've never tasted better fries nor more nutritious fries. Potatoes aren't that common in Kenya but bananas and roots are. They taste as good as any fast food French fries and are healthier. Green bananas are the healthiest because they have all their vitamins where ripe ones lose most of them because they're too ripe.  Green bananas do not have a strong banana flavor at all. It's very deceptive and very healthy. I couldn't stop eating them.",
