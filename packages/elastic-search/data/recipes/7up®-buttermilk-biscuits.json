    "category": "bread",
    "author": "Christine Weber",
    "summary": "Incredibly simple yet outrageously tasty; sour cream makes them super moist and tender. Reminiscent of the original Kentucky Fried Chicken\u00ae biscuits, but much better! Great with all kinds of meals but they make an especially fantastic biscuits and gravy breakfast (or lunch or dinner).",
