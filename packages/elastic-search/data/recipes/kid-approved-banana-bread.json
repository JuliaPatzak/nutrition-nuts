    "summary": "This bread is moist and delicious, relatively low in fat, and constantly requested by my four kids for snacks or their school lunches. They even avoid eating all the bananas so there are enough left to ripen to black for banana bread! Freezes well too. Just cool fully and place in an airtight bag or container.",
