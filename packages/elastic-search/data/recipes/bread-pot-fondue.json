    "summary": "This is a yummy appetizer. Creamy, cheesy and spicy - a variety of flavors are blended throughout. A real treat for your palate. Easy to put together, and well worth the time in the oven. You can bake the scooped out pieces of bread and use them for dipping.  I usually buy an extra loaf of bread, just for dipping.",
