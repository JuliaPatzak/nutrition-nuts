    "summary": "A quick, spicy sausage cheese dip. This isn't tea party food, nothing dainty or low-fat about it. This is an appetizer that eats like a MEAL and it keeps guests coming back to the bowl. You may have to work out twice to make up for it, but you'll be happy you did! Best served hot with plenty of tortilla chips.",
