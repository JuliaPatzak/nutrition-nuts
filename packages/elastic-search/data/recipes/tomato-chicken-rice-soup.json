    "summary": "This is a soup my mom used to make for me any time I caught a cold. She used to call it French Canadian penicillin (she was 100% French Canadian). This is one of my favorite comfort foods and is truly wonderful when feeling under the weather. You'll want to play with it to get the thickness and garlic level right for your tastes, but it is well worth it.",
