    "summary": "Flan is a traditional Spanish/Hispanic dessert that can be dressed up any way from chocolate to traditional. This flan is simple, yet creamy and smooth. If you have never had flan or just couldn't seem to get it right, I can assure you that your family and friends will want the recipe. Be daring and try other extracts like almond or orange.",
