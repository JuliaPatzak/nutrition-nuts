    "summary": "What I like the most about these muffins is that the spices make the muffin what it is. The raw cane sugar and whole wheat pastry flour are the best to use because they are the least processed ingredients available and retain more of their natural goodness. The chunky apple bits give me more for my bite and add another level of sweetness to the muffin. These make a great breakfast or brunch item, or you can have one with a cup of coffee and unwind! Enjoy!",
