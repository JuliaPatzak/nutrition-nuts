    "summary": "This luscious, deeply flavored dish, originally created by a Pakistani food cart vendor in Delhi, is a cinch to make in an Instant Pot\u00ae. After an overnight marinade in yogurt and traditional spices, you can use an Instant Pot\u00ae to cook every step, from toasting spices to cooking aromatics, to adding the tomatoes and chile. You can even make a batch of basmati rice ahead. This dinner will be such a treat.",
