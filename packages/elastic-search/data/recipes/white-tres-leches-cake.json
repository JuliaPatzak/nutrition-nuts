    "summary": "A friend of mine requested a tres leches cake that wasn't soggy but full of flavor that could be decorated. This is what I came up with. Fill cake with vanilla cream mousse filling and top with your favorite buttercream recipe. You can also make a 9x13-inch sheet cake and soak with the tres milks, cut into individual servings, and top with mousse rosettes.",
