    "summary": "This recipe is inspired by fried buttercup squash patties that I had at the best Caribbean restaurant in town! Enjoy the complex and satisfying mix of garlic and chili pepper, with just a tinge of sweetness. These are great for appetizers, a light lunch with salad, or even for brunch! The sweet potatoes can be replaced with a winter squash, such as buttercup. Serve them warm, plain, or topped with maple syrup or a fruit chutney.",
