    "summary": "It doesn't have any ice cream but tastes like a milkshake! This is a recipe that my uncle told me about. At first I thought, 'Gross! That sounds terrible!' As it turns out everyone in my family loves it; even my picky sister who hates bananas! This is a recipe for when the kids say, 'Mom can we go to Sonic\u00ae? We want a milkshake!' And instead the kids can eat a delicious, healthy, and filling summer snack. The most important direction of all: Enjoy!",
