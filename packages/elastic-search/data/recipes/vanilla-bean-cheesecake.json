    "summary": "If you like restaurant vanilla bean cheesecake, then try this!  The cookies make this one much more special and far more yummy. Pure vanilla bean extract is a must.  I use Tahitian vanilla beans and extract.  This also makes more than enough batter for a 10 inch pan, so you can make cupcakes too.",
