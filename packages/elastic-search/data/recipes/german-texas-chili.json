    "summary": "Fred is German and I am Texan!  This creation is a blend of the two!  Have a different ethnic background?  You can easily add spices and other ingredients to make it your own, although, we have to say - it's quite good the way it is. This can  easily be prepared the day before or put into the freezer for later use. Serve over baked potato or corn chips with \u2018fixins' such as sour cream, grated cheese, onions, etc.  For a richer flavor, you are able to make this dish the night before and keep in refrigerator until the next day. Enjoy!",
