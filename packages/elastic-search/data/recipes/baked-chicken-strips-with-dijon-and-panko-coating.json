    "summary": "Wow, this is a new favorite! I can't believe how easy and how moist and good the chicken tasted. I made it exactly as posted, and my husband and I both loved it. It's in my regular meal rotation now. The chicken strips are first coated with a garlic-Dijon mustard mixture, then pressed in a panko bread crumb mixture before baking. The results is moist, delicious chicken with a slightly crunchy coating. Easy and delicious.",
