    "summary": "This is a tart, yet sweet, pie I make with sour Montmorency cherries found on a tree in my yard. I recommend using Trader Joe's French Pastry pie crust, and a woven top really shows off the cherries. It turns out perfect every time! Serve plain or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",
