    "summary": "This is a delicious twist on a soul food staple! They are never bitter. I got the recipe from a Liberian restaurant. You may think the ingredients are strange, but they come together perfectly. You may want to adjust the amounts to your taste. When cooking something like greens, eyeballing is the best measurement. The longer you cook these, the more the flavors mesh and the better they taste.",
