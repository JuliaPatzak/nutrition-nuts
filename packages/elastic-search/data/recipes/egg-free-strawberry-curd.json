    "summary": "Curd is so simple but it seems like it takes forever to make. I love using this as an addition into homemade yogurt. I found by eliminating the egg (oh the horror!), the curd still thickens as the moisture evaporated. If you want to include the egg to be traditional, by all means add in an egg yolk when the strawberries are pureed.",
