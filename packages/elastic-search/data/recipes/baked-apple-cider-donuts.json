    "summary": "All the world's great donuts are fried, except there are a few rare examples of when they're not--and this incredibly delicious and easy-to-make apple cider donut is one notable exception. Since we're not going to fry these, not only are they easier, but they're way less messy. Less time cleaning up means more time eating donuts.",

        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Butter two 6-cup donut pans",
        "Pour apple cider into a saucepan and place over medium heat",
        "Bring to a simmer and let it cook, watching carefully, until the cider is reduced to 1/2 cup",
        "If it reduces too much, add enough water to make 1/2 cup",
        "Set aside until needed",
