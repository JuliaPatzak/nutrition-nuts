    "summary": "I had an abundance of apples and needed to use them.  We love apple crisp but I just made it a few days before.  Pie sounded nice, so I combined 4 different recipes to get this one.  It has almost a shortbread type crust and is just the right balance of sweet and tart.  I had to hurry and write the recipe down so I wouldn't forget it because I will definitely be making this again!",

        "To make the topping, combine 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of flour, and the oats; with a pastry cutter, cut in 6 tablespoons of butter, until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs",
        "Spoon the topping evenly over the apple filling",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the apple filling is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, about 40 minutes",
        "If the crust begins to look  brown after about 20 minutes of baking, cover the crust edge with a strip of aluminum foil"
