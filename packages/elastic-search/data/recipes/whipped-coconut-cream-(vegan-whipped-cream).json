    "summary": "Here in the Northwest many friends are a) vegan b) avoiding dairy c) lactose-intolerant or d) all of the above. This recipe makes sure they don't miss out on one of the best parts of dessert: whipped cream! Keep a can or two of coconut milk in your fridge so that you're always ready to make this recipe! Variations on this basic version abound: add citrus zest, matcha (green tea) powder, cocoa, almond extract, pumpkin pie spice, mmm...! Plan ahead, because the coconut milk needs to chill overnight.",
