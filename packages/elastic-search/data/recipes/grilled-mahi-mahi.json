    "summary": "This recipe is great either on the grill or in the oven broiler. The tomatoes give it a little bite. My entire family loves it, even my pickiest eater. In the winter I make this dish in my oven or broiler. The amounts I gave are approximate. I use two cans of tomatoes when I want more 'bite,' only one can when I want less. I like a lot of garlic so I generally use a lot.",
