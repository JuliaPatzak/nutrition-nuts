    "summary": "My husband is a Spaniard, so I started looking into paella. It took me 4 times to get this right. It has become his favorite dish and expects me to make this every week. I have tweaked this recipe to our taste, so the red pepper, capers, and black olives are simply a preference for us. The vinegar is a Spanish thing, so I always add it. You can leave a little broth in the paella, or cook until the broth is fully absorbed.  It is simply a preference.",
