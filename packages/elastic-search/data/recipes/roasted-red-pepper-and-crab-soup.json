    "summary": "Although this is not a typical traditional holiday recipe, it has become a Christmas day buffet favorite in our family. Several years ago, we decided to forgo our traditional big sit-down dinner for a buffet because of everyone's increasingly different visiting/family obligations on that day. Everyone could eat whenever or if they chose to. I'd had this soup, which I loved, at several different restaurants over time. Through trial and error, I came up with my own recipe, which has been a hit.  I serve it with a dollop of creme fraiche.",
