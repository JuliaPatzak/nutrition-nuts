    "summary": "This recipe is a variation of Sicilian Caponata, which is an eggplant relish served in Sicily as a topping for brushetta or as a condiment served with meat or fish.  My family loves it as a dip for tortilla chips or even by the spoonful (if no one's looking!).  Be sure to microwave the eggplant, or it will absorb too much oil and become mushy.",
