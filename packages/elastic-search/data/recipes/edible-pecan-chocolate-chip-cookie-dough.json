    "summary": "I have been experimenting with different no-bake edible cookie dough and feel this is the best one so far. This is delicious and safe to eat since it is made without eggs. Other ingredients can be added, such as M&M'S\u00ae, toasted coconut, peanut butter chips, raisins ... The list can go on and on. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days.",
