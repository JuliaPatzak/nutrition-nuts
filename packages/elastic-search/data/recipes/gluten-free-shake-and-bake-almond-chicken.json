    "summary": "This is my go-to recipe when I'm in a hurry. It's so easy, and yet so good. Because of the coating, the chicken is always extra juicy. Kids can't tell they're nuts (looks like breading) and love it. It's healthy (and grain-free for those with allergies). Everyone asks me for the recipe...that's my cue to add it to Allrecipes!",
