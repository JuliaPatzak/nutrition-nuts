    "directions": [
        "Place the onion and garlic into a large slow cooker",
        "Pour in the ketchup, beer, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke; set aside",
        "Combine the salt, pepper, chili powder, paprika, oregano, and brown sugar until evenly blended",
        "Rub the spice mixture all over the beef brisket",
        "Place the brisket into the slow cooker",
        "Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture over top",
        "Cover, and cook on Low until the beef is easily shredded with two forks, 10 to 12 hours",
        "Remove the beef from the slow cooker, and place into a large bowl",
        "Ladle the fat from the remaining sauce in the slow cooker and discard",

        "Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot",
        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the sauce right in the slow cooker",
        "Stir the shredded beef and pureed sauce together in the slow cooker",
        "Use tongs to serve the beef on the potato buns"
