    "summary": "This no doubt is the easiest Caprese salad I have ever made, and it will make your guest smile! It screams delicious, plus you can make ahead of time which is something we all want more of. When making, you can also add all ingredients to a large resealable plastic bag. Mix and then pour into your serving bowls/glasses. Serve in a fun type of tall stem glass like a martini glass with some crostini on the side.",
