    "summary": "Always looking for low-carb recipes, I was making my family lasagna and got the idea to make my lasagna in a 'green pepper boat' instead of using noodles. This tastes great even to people who love carbs! Freezes well too.  If I make a smaller batch, I will freeze the leftover sauce for the next time.",
