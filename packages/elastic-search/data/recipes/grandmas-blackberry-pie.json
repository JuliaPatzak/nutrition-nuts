        "Cut in the cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs",

        "Turn mixture into a bowl and proceed",
        ") Stir in the egg and vinegar mixture",
        "Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until the flour mixture is moistened",

        "Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to three days",

        "Sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar",
        "Place the second pie crust on top of the fruit mixture, and pinch the top and bottom crusts together",
        "Lightly sprinkle the top crust with water, followed by the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar",
        "Poke several holes in the top of the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes"
