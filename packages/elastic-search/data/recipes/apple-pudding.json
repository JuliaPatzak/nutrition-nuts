    "summary": "A recipe that was handed down through the years from Mother to Daughter.  It's just a simple and easy 'Apple Pudding' recipe. When you are in a hurry and have very few staples on hand, you may want to give this dessert a try.  That is the basic recipe and good for the times of depression when extras are scarce. Serve either hot or cold. It is good plain but better with milk, cream, whipped cream or lemon sauce.",
