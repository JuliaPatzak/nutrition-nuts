    "summary": "This has been popular in my family for decades. The old way my father made it was to grind the cheese in a meat grinder, then beat the mixture in the electric mixer, which was time consuming. I've experimented and developed a quicker way to make it with a food processor. Just make sure you have one with a strong motor. The spread keeps for at least a couple of weeks in the fridge. Before serving, it is better to let it come to room temperature. Serve with crackers as an appetizer. Can be warmed in the microwave for Welsh rarebit as well.",
