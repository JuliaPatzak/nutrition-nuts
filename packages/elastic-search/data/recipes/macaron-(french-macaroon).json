    "summary": "This is the quintessential macaron (NOT macaroon) recipe. I am a baker's apprentice, and after much trial and error, we (the baker and I) finally perfected the technique. We decided to share with you all. Pipe your choice of filling on a cookie and sandwich another cookie on top. These are like cloud cookie sandwiches and are delicious if done correctly.  If you want to do it the super-easy way, just fill with your favorite flavor of frosting. Enjoy!",

    "ingredients": [
        "3  egg whites",
        "\u00bc cup white sugar",
        "1\u2009\u2154 cups confectioners' sugar",
        "1 cup finely ground almonds"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat",
        "Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until whites are foamy; beat in white sugar and continue beating until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks",
        "Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl and quickly fold the almond mixture into the egg whites, about 30 strokes",
        "Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet",
        "If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest",
        "When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip",
        "Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks",
        "Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour",
        "Preheat oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C)",
        "Bake cookies until set but not browned, about 10 minutes; let cookies cool completely before filling"
