    "summary": "My gal loves prawns, so I looked at all the ways to prepare them with as little 'fridge-to-fork' time as possible. Makes for great 'Movie Night' finger food. There will be a bit of butter brew left, either in the bowl, or on the plate. Onion bread is a good way to clean that up.  Serve with a side of vegetables to make a meal of it.",
