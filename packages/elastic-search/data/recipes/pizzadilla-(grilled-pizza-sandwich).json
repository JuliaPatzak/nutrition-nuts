    "summary": "I was watching TV the other day, and I saw a commercial for something called a Papadilla. What follows is my attempt to make one of these things. What this relatively fast and easy procedure allows you to do is make a single portion of what's very, very close to pizza in a pan on top of the stove in just a few minutes, without ever having to turn on the oven. Serve your pizzadilla with a side salad topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.",
