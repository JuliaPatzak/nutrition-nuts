    "summary": "This is a bold, flavorful hummus with a bit of heat. The lemon juice and zest give a wonderful brightness that my children and grandchildren seem to love. The ingredients are usually available in my pantry, so I can make this at a moment's notice. This, of course, is to my taste, and I like lots of flavor, so a little goes a long way. I hope you enjoy!",
