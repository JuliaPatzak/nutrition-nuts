    "summary": "This is an extremely simple, but very enjoyable main course. I generally stick it in the oven, then make potato wedges or my squash (sauteed yellow squash and zucchini) while it's baking. I began using sage on salmon during my college years, when I grew entirely too much of the herb, and put it in pretty much everything. It became my favorite herb, and lends a delicate and unexpected taste and scent to this dish. I tend to cook the salmon in the oven during the winter, but grilling works nicely as well, especially charcoal grills.",
