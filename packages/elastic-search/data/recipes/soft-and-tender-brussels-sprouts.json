    "summary": "These Brussels are roasted on a lower heat so you get both soft and tender and brown and crispy sprouts. I like roasted sprouts but found high-temp recipes left me with really charred results, and some of the sprouts were still hard. If I was making these for myself, I'd drizzle some balsamic reduction on top to finish, but my family wouldn't care for that.",
