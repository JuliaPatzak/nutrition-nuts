    "summary": "A Greek-inspired halibut dish that is simple enough for a weeknight but nice enough for company! I love Greek food and I love to make homemade tzatziki sauce. I keep some in the fridge all the time and am always looking for new ways to use it. Being from Alaska, we always have an abundance of halibut, a delicious and delicate white fish native to the area. I hope you love this recipe as much as my family does!",
