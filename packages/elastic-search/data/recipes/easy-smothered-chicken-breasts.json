    "summary": "After reading this recipe here, it sounded so good that I had to put my personal touches to it. I'm not particularly fond of chicken breasts unless they're flattened to a pulp and delicately browned after being dredged in flour. After that I followed the original recipe except I added crushed red peppers and Italian seasoning. I served this with fettuccine alfredo and roasted asparagus on the side. Delizioso!",
