        "Cut the cold butter and cream cheese into the flour with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs",
        "(This can also be done in a food processor: pulse the cold butter into the flour until the mixture resembles cornmeal; add the cream cheese and pulse until it's the size of small peas",
        ") When you squeeze a handful of the mixture, it should form a ball",
        "Shape the dough into a round disk, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour",

        "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",

        "Transfer the dough to the tart pan or baking sheet",

        "Bake the tart in the preheated oven until the crust is browned and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes",
        "Remove the tart from the oven and brush it with the apricot jam"
