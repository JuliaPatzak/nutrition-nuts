    "summary": "Consistently great and easy pasta dough. This makes really great homemade linguine or ravioli for a manual pasta machine. If its too sticky, just roll a bit in flour. This recipe makes enough pasta for 24 small raviolis or 4 servings of linguine. Whatever pasta you make should take no more than 4 to 6 minutes to boil.",
