    "summary": "I've tried several no-knead bread recipes, and wanted to see if the approach would work for pizza. Happily, it does. Start the dough the night before and let it do its thing until you're ready to shape, top, and bake! If not using right away, wrap well in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month.",
