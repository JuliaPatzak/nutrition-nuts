    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups prepared kumquats",
        "Zest and juice of 1 lemon",
        "small pinch of cayenne",
        "1 star anise (I removed it after 10 minutes of simmering)",
        "1 cup white sugar",
        "1 cup cold water"

        "Cover and let sit at room temperature 2 or 3 hours to allow fruit to macerate",
        "Or you can refrigerate overnight",
        "Place pot over medium-high heat and bring mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally",
        "Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir occasionally for 10 minutes",
        "Continuing cooking and stirring often until mixture is thick enough so that if you scrape a spatula across the bottom of the pan, you can briefly see the bottom of the pan before marmalade spreads back out, 30 to 40 minutes",
        "Mixture should reach a temperature of 215 to 220 degrees F (120 to 125 degrees C)",
        "Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes",
