    "summary": "This is a variation of Chilean empanadas that I made to simplify my husband's favorite recipe from his home country. The meat filling is a harmonious mix of beef, raisins, and olives that will make your tongue tingle when you take your first bite. And don't be surprised when you've eaten more of the pie than you had planned.",
