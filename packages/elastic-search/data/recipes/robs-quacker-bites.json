    "summary": "This is a great way to quickly cook duck or goose breasts. My husband is a duck hunter, but he doesn't really care for traditional duck recipes so he came up with this and everyone raves! It works well for duck or goose. If you can find Dale's Seasoning, a seasoning sauce with 11 spices, that's our favorite for the marinade. The recipe is easily adapted as hunters' success rates tend to vary.",
