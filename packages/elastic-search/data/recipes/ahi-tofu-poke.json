    "summary": "A vegetarian take on the classic tuna poke Hawaiian appetizer. Surprisingly, this is really just as delicious, is always a crowd-pleaser, and is beautiful! Yes, I actually ran a beet through my juicer as suggested by my friend Deanna when I was running the idea by her. This gives the tofu a reddish-pink color like tuna. Garnish with sesame seeds and hoisin or sriracha sauce.",
