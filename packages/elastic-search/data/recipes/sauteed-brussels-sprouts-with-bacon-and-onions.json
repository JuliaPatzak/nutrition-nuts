    "summary": "This is a simple yet delicious recipe that takes little time to put together. It's a tasty way to incorporate a healthy, and often snubbed, vegetable into one's diet. I've been cooking Brussels sprouts this way for years. I'm not sure where I got the recipe. Using fresh Brussels sprouts is preferred naturally, but if not readily available, frozen Brussels sprouts may be used instead. If using frozen Brussels sprouts, you may have to drain any excess liquid that is rendered while cooking the sprouts.",
