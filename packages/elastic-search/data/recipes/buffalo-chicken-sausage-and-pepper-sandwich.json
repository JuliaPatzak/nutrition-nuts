    "summary": "This is a tasty and very easy sandwich to make. It is sort of a cross between a peppers and onion sandwich with sausage and a buffalo chicken cheese steak. You can make it as hot or mild as you like. I use this sandwich as dinner with soup and salad. A very satisfying meal. The amount of blue cheese depends on how messy or not you like your sandwich to be.",
