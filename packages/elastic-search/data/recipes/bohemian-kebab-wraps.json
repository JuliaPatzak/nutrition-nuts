    "summary": "These are to die for! Beef steak, bell peppers, and onion are skewered, seasoned, and grilled on the barbeque or cooked in the oven (you can add whatever you like). Then they are taken off the skewer and rolled in a tortilla. To top it off, you dip the whole thing in garlic butter. Enjoy!",
