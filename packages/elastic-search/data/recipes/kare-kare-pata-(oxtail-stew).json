    "summary": "This dish is rich in flavor due to the slow cooking of the oxtail. Oxtail can be cooked to tenderness a day before so you can skim off the fat making the dish more heart healthy. Using a pressure cooker will speed up cooking time, but will lose much of the flavor. Serve with rice and shrimp paste (bagoong).",
