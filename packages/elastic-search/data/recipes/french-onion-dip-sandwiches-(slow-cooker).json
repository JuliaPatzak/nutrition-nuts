    "summary": "This combines the greatness that is French onion soup with French dips. It is not supposed to be an 'authentic' French dip recipe, because authentic is often boring. These are yummy sandwiches for those that like roast beef and French onion soup. It is mainly on the slow cooker, but it requires a bit of prep on the stove, too.",
