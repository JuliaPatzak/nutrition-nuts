    "summary": "Tex-Mex chicken fajita ingredients put in an egg roll. If you have access to a turkey fryer, I recommend using it to cook these in order to cut down on number of batches and speed up the cooking process. This can be an appetizer or part of a full meal. Goes great with ginger soy sauce or even some pico de gallo.",
