    "summary": "The richness of the avocado makes this dish taste amazing. Feel free to add more or less olive oil for your preferred consistency. For best results refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. Enjoy and feel guilt-free (unless you eat the whole bowl, which might just happen). It is easy to tweak this recipe to anything you like; add cooked chicken, or stir in some tuna, add some more veggies, or take some out that you don't like or have on hand.",
