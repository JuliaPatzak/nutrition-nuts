    "summary": "I modified my mother's chicken and sausage gumbo recipe to make it gluten-free. Good gumbo is hard to find for my friend with a wheat allergy. The wheat flour roux is the key ingredient for any gumbo. After experimenting with a few gluten-free alternatives, I find that a light brown millet flour roux thickens the gumbo and gives an excellent taste nearly equal to wheat flour. Most people won't notice the difference.",
