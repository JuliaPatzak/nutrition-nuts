    "summary": "Jazz up your pork tenderloin with this spicy-sweet combo of apples, cider, sweet potatoes, and as much or as little heat as your palate requires! This easy oven dish only needs one other pot to reduce the sauce on top of the stove. It is large enough for a crowd or for leftovers later in the week. Add a green veggie or a salad, and some crusty dinner bread, and you are good to go!",
