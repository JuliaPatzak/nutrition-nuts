    "summary": "I wanted to make a sweet popcorn that was delicious but not loaded with sugar, so I came up with this recipe. It's one of my kids' favorites! Olive oil works if you don't have coconut oil. If you accidentally add to much salt, add a little more honey. If it's too sweet, add a little more salt. Start with a little cinnamon and gradually add more until it is the flavor you desire.",
