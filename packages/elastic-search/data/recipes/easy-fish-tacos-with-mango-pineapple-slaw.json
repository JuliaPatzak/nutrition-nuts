    "summary": "I used to make these all the time in California and they are so easy and fresh! You can also omit the mayonnaise and increase the red vinegar to reduce calories. All in all, these are a great main dish for any time of year! We usually serve them with fat-free refried beans topped with cilantro and goat cheese, or a cold corn salad with chopped bell pepper and onion.",
