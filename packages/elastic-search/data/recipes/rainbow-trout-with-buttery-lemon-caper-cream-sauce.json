    "summary": "I'm an amateur cook who likes to experiment. I made this rainbow trout recipe up along with my 12-year-old son who is finding his own love for cooking. It's special to me because we did that, together, in our kitchen: father and son time. I serve it on sauteed spinach and potatoes. It is my very own recipe.",
