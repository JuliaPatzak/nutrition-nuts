    "summary": "The only tricky part of this recipe is working with phyllo, and once you get the hang of it, it's fun. Sometimes you get a bad batch of phyllo that rips and tears easily, so I always buy an extra just in case. I have frozen these before baking.  Just add a few minutes to cooking time when you cook them in a frozen state.  I have also doubled this recipe for large parties.",
