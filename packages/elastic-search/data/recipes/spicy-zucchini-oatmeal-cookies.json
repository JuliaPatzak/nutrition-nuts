    "summary": "In my efforts to use the abundance of zucchini in my garden I concocted this little cookie.  I prefer my oatmeal cookies to have a little jazz, so if you are not a fan of ground cloves, they can be omitted.  It's a not too sweet cake-like cookie that is perfect with your cup of coffee or tea.",
