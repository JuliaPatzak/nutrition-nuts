    "summary": "This is a variation on a simpler dinner I wanted to add some more flavor to. The added flavor comes from North African spices. The broth used to poach the fish can be easily multiplied to create a wonderful soup to which you can add tomatoes, beans, green peppers, and any other veggies you would like. Serve with any green veggie and either noodles, rice, or potatoes to make a full meal. Enjoy!",
