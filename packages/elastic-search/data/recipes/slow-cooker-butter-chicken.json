    "summary": "Indian food is one of my favorites, so when my friend made this slow cooker version for my family we were head over heels!  I don't think I've had a Butter Chicken that I've liked more.  It's wonderful to put into the slow cooker in the morning and come home to the warm Indian spice smell....LOVE IT! Serve with basmati rice and warm naan bread.",
