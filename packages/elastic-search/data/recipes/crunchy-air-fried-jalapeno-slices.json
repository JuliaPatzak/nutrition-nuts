    "summary": "I first had these at a restaurant inside a casino in Tulsa, OK and it was love at first bite. I got to craving them the other day but didn't want the guilt of the deep-fry. I whipped up a batch in the air fryer and they turned out crispier than the deep-fried version. Don't forget the ranch!",
