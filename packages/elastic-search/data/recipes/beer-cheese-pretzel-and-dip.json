    "summary": "My best friend shared this recipe with me, and we are SO SICK of making it -- but it's always requested at our parties! We have made the pretzel in various shapes, depending on the occasion (e.g., hearts, sorority letters, etc.). The pretzel may be partially baked ahead of time and frozen. The dip may also be prepared in advance.",
