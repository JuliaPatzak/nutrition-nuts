    "summary": "It's quick, easy, super nutritious and tastes absolutely fantastic. Win win win! You can make up the chickpea salad part ahead of time, and make it into a sandwich when you want it by drizzling some olive oil on the bread and spoon the mix on top. Ingredients can vary - basically whatever veggies you can find. Feel free to substitute as necessary.",
