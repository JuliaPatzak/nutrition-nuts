    "summary": "My Indian mother-in-law's recipe. It is my favorite way to eat shrimp now. The spice measurements are approximate because of course she doesn't measure, so adjust to your liking. Indians will also make this dish with potatoes (which need to be boiled ahead) or cauliflower instead of green pepper. It would work with just about any veggie you like with shrimp.",
