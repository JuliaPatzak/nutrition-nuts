    "summary": "I have been looking for a wonderful, rich queso dip. I took the best of two recipes that sounded good, plus added my own flair. I made this for my family and co-workers and had to make another batch, because there wasn't any left for me! Transfer finished dip to a small slow cooker to keep warm; serve with tortilla chips or add to your favorite Mexican dish! Enjoy!",
