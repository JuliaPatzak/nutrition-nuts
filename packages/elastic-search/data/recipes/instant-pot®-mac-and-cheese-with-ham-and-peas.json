    "summary": "Forget about the blue box (you know what I'm talking about) and make homemade mac and cheese for a weeknight dinner. The ham, peas, and optional hot sauce add some pizzazz to classic mac and cheese. Adjust the consistency of the mac and cheese sauce to suit your personal preference. I used Kraft\u00ae 2% Milk Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese to reduce fat with no negative effect on taste.",
