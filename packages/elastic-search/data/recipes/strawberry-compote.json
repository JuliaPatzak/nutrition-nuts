    "summary": "This simple strawberry compote has the consistency of a chunky fruit syrup and will liven up yogurt, oatmeal, scones, and ice cream. It also makes the most delicious topping for crepes! The touch of balsamic gives it a pop of acidity and a deeper flavor. Feel free to mash the berries with a fork or potato masher for a smoother consistency. Refrigerate for up to 1 week.",
