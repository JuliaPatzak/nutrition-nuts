    "summary": "I have always loved making hummus for my family (which usually includes tahini). When I discovered my son was allergic to soy (which is in most all store-bought tahini), I decided to make my own and it turned out even better than any other store-bought brand! Made as described this recipe is Paleo-diet friendly, soy free, dairy free, gluten free, and grain free. Enjoy!",
