    "summary": "A local restaurant in North Carolina made these. I loved them, but they were horribly expensive. So I figured out how to make them on my own. They are truly rich and delicious. Serve about 6 each as an appetizer. The filling is soft and creamy, if you prefer a firmer filling add an egg white to the cheese mixture.",
