    "summary": "This easy and delicious simple rice pudding is made with all organic ingredients, loaded with coconut milk, vanilla, and nutmeg for such a comforting treat! For a vegan version, omit the eggs, and use almond milk in place of the dairy and replace butter with vegan buttery sticks. Both versions are quite delicious! Just make sure to let the pudding cool to room temperature to let pudding set and then place in refrigerator to chill for at least 3 hours. Enjoy!",
