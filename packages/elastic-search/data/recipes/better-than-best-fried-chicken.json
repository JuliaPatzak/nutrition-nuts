        "1  egg",
        "seasoning salt to taste",
        "\u00bd cup all-purpose flour",

    "directions": [
        "In a shallow dish or bowl combine the soup, egg and seasoning salt (be careful, as soup is already salted); mix together",
        "Dip chicken in mixture and turn to coat completely",
        "Set aside",
        "In a resealable plastic bag mix together the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper",
        "One at a time, place chicken pieces in bag, seal and shake to coat",
        "Add more flour and/or cornstarch as necessary, but add them in equal parts (there should be an equal amount of each in the mixture)",
        "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Be sure to use enough oil to cover chicken pieces",
        "Place coated chicken on a platter and allow to sit until it becomes doughy (this is critical, to ensure crispiness when fried)",
