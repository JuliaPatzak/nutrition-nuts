        "5  eggs",
        "3\u2009\u00bd cups whole milk",
        "1 cup sugar",

    "directions": [
        "Cut the bread into cubes and let sit out about an hour to dry out a bit",
        "Using day-old bread is perfect; the drier the bread cubes, the more yumminess they soak up! Preheat oven to 350 degrees F",
        "In a medium bowl, mix the eggs until they are combined",
        "Add the milk, sugar, and vanilla and stir until combined",
        "Place the bread cubes in a baking pan and pour the milk and egg mixture over them",
        "Melt butter in a small microwave-proof bowl",
        "Stir in the brown sugar until dissolved",
        "Stir in the pecans",
        "Pour this mixture over the bread and egg mixture, and gently fold",
        "Don't mix it in thoroughly, just fold so the yummy pecan mixture forms into clumps throughout the bread pudding",
        "Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the top is slightly brown",
        "The center will still be a little jiggly",
        "Allow to cool at least 20 minutes before serving",
        "The egg mixture will continue to cook, and the bread will soak up more yumminess"
