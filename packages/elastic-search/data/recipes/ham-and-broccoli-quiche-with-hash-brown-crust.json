    "summary": "This ham and broccoli quiche recipe is partially my own and partially from Barbie Anderson of my cooking club group.  It's creamy, flavorful, and not too fattening! The recipe calls for deli ham, but I used leftover ham from Christmas and I think the thicker, diced ham made it taste great.",
