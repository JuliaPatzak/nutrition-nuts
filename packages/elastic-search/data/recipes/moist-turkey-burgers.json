    "summary": "I changed the recipe to make these delicious burgers for more people. I caramelized the onions to give it more depth of flavor. I also added Dijon mustard and real garlic instead of garlic powder. I also cut down on the amount of bread crumbs and made them out of whole wheat to make them a little healthier. I also omitted the soy sauce for the same reason. They came out great. The only thing I would do different next time is to give them just a little heat. Enjoy.",
