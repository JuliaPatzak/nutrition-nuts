    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups self-rising flour",
        "2 tablespoons white sugar",
        "\u2154 cup shortening",
        "2 cups buttermilk"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Sift together the flour and sugar in a large bowl",
        "Cut in the shortening until the mixture has a fine crumb or cornmeal texture",
        "Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until a soft dough forms",
        "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, pulling off any pieces sticking inside the bowl",
        "Gather dough into a ball and knead about 20 times, until smooth and elastic",
        "Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight",
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Working on a floured surface, roll or pat the dough out to 1 inch thickness",
        "Cut into rounds with a 2 inch biscuit cutter, or the floured rim of a glass, by pressing straight down and up",
        "Twisting the cutter will prevent the biscuits from rising as high",
        "Place biscuits about 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet, and allow to rest a few minutes",
        "Bake in preheated oven until lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes",
        "Cool on a wire rack",
        "Serve warm"
