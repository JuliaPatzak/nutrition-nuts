    "summary": "This is a traditional Swedish rye bread. Be sure that the seeds you use for this bread are fresh. You may substitute rye flour for the whole wheat flour, however, it will affect the taste. I prefer whole wheat. Also, gluten, a very important ingredient in this recipe, may be found in most gourmet food stores or health food stores. Barley malt can be substituted for molasses. Enjoy!",
