        "\u00bd cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed",
        "1  large egg",
        "\u00bd teaspoon kosher salt",
        "1 pinch cayenne pepper",
        "1 tablespoon creme fraiche, sour cream, or plain yogurt",
        "3 tablespoons milk, or as needed"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Place flour, egg, salt, cayenne, cream fraiche, and milk in a mixing bowl",
        "Whisk together until batter drips slowly off the whisk",
        "If batter seems too thin, add a bit more flour; if too thick, add a bit more milk",
        "You can test the thickness using the smooth side of a cheese grater with fairly large holes",
        "If a dollop of the batter does not drip through the grating holes, it's the right consistency",
        "Bring a pot of salted water to a simmer over medium-high heat",
        "Use a spatula to push a spoonful of batter through the holes of the smooth side of the grater into the simmering water",
        "When dumplings rise to the surface of the water, they are done",
        "This will take just a few minutes",
        "Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon, and repeat in batches with remaining batter"
