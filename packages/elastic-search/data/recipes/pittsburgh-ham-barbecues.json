    "summary": "I grew up on these delicious, sweet, and tangy barbecue sandwiches made from chipped deli ham. This dish is a  staple in Western Pennsylvania, although each family seems to have its own way of making them! It's a terrific last-minute meal. Chipped chopped ham is a pressed ham loaf sold at deli counters in the Pittsburgh area which is always chipped. If you can get Islay's Chipped Ham, that is the original and still the best for these sandwiches. Otherwise, just get any deli ham and have it chipped or shaved paper thin. Enjoy!",
