    "summary": "This sweet and creamy ricotta toast makes the perfect brunch or mid-day snack. Grilling the fruit adds a lovely caramelized flavor, topped with the sweetness from the honey, crunch from the almonds and brightness from the hint of fresh mint.  Use a thick-cut crusty bread like sourdough so it can stand up to the toppings.",
