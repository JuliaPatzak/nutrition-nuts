    "summary": "This is a very simple and surprisingly flavorful recipe for smoked nachos prepared on a charcoal grill. The chips, cheese, and beans really soak up the smoke flavor in just a few minutes. Smoke is the most important ingredient, so a charcoal grill is required (unless you can use wood chips in your gas grill). We usually serve it as an appetizer, but it is often requested as the main dish.",
