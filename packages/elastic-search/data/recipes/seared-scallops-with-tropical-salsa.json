    "summary": "The delicious taste of scallops is perfectly complemented by a wonderful fresh fruit salsa in this quick but elegant dish. Be sure to use large, plump sea scallops rather than smaller bay scallops and take care not to overcook the scallops; they should remain tender and moist. Feel free to substitute any of your favorite exotic fruits for the pineapple and mango in the salsa.",
