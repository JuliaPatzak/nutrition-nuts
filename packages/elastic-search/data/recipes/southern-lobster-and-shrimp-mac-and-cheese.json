    "summary": "This is a creamy, rich, and decadent recipe for an 'over the top' addition to any meal. After years of making basic mac and cheese, this version with shrimp and lobster is an indulgence worth making for those special to you. It is an adapted recipe from strong Southern women (Patti LaBelle, Mama Jean, and my son's girlfriend Ashley)...all wonderful foodies! I make this a day ahead.",
