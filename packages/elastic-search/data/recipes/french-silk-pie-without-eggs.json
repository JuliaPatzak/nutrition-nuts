    "summary": "This is a beautiful, fluffy French silk Pie. Garnishing it with extra whipped cream and chocolate curls makes it fabulous! I recently made one for a pie auction and it sold for $65.00! Yes, it really is that tasty. I've been making this pie by memory for years, so I have no idea of the recipe's origin. For a higher, more impressive pie, whip 1 extra cup of whipping cream and add it to the top of the pie, before garnishing with shaved chocolate.",
