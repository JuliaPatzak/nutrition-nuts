    "summary": "Using milk instead of water in the arepas will make them a little richer, a little denser, and, that's right - delicious! Split and serve with a pat of butter and a drizzle of honey, or make a breakfast sandwich with a drizzle of maple syrup, a slice of cheese and cooked ham, and a fried egg.",

        "\u00be cup milk at room temperature",
        "\u00bc cup cream cheese at room temperature",
        "\u00bd teaspoon salt",
        "1 teaspoon white sugar",

    "directions": [
        "Mix milk, cream cheese, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk together until smooth and foamy",
        "Add sugar and arepas flour to milk mixture; mix with a spatula until dough is soft, thick, and workable, about 1 minute",
        "Divide dough into 4 portions (for the 4 wells in the maker)",
        "Form each quarter into a ball and use wet hands to gently shape it into a thick patty about 1/2-inch thick",
        "If you see little cracks on the outside, the dough may be a little too dry; add more milk",
        "Heat arepas maker; lightly coat wells of the arepas machine with vegetable oil",
        "Place patties into wells of maker, close lid, and let cook through one cooking cycle of machine, about 5 minutes",
        "For a crisper crust, flip arepas, using a wooden spoon or spatula, and repeat cooking cycle for 5 more minutes",
        "Patties will be crusty and browned on both sides and the insides will be cooked all the way through"
