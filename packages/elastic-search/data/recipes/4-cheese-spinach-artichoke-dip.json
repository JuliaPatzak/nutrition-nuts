    "summary": "This is my first submitted recipe. I have tried many other spinach dip recipes from this website, but felt like something was missing or they were too \"Alfredo-ey.\" So I modified the recipes I found to eliminate the Alfredo sauce and substituted in the cheeses I had on hand. Voila! A delicious recipe that I felt proud to share with my fellow cooks. Serve with chips or veggies. I hope you enjoy!",

        "1 (16 ounce) bag fresh spinach, chopped",
        "\u00bd cup chopped marinated artichoke hearts",
        "2 tablespoons diced onion",
        "1 teaspoon bottled minced garlic",
        "1 teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "\u00bd teaspoon salt",
        "\u00bd teaspoon red pepper flakes",
        "\u00bd (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened",
        "\u00bc cup grated Parmesan cheese",
        "2 ounces processed cheese food (such as Velveeta\u00ae), cubed",
        "2 ounces horseradish Cheddar cheese"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat",
        "Add spinach, artichoke hearts, and any marinade oil that remains after chopping them",
        "Add onion, garlic, pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes; cook, stirring regularly so it doesn't burn on the bottom, until spinach has wilted and mixture is wet, about 3 minutes",
        "Reduce heat to low and add cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, processed cheese, and Cheddar cheese",
        "Stir occasionally and allow to simmer, uncovered, until cheeses have melted and some of the water from the spinach has cooked off, about 3 more minutes",
