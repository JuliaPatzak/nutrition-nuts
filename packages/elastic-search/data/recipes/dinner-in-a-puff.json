    "summary": "I found this idea on the internet and have fiddled around with different flavor combinations. The kids like these because I give each child a 6-cup muffin tin and each chooses what goes in their 6 cups. They usually make three savory and three sweet. These are quick and easy. If you don't have puff pastry then try pie crust, ready made biscuit dough or crescent dough. Easy dinner in a puff!",
