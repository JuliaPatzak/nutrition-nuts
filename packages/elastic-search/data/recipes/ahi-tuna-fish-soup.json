    "summary": "This fish soup is SO SIMPLE, DELICIOUS, and amazingly HEALTHY for you! You can make it with things you probably already have in your fridge and is great served with a cup of rice! Try it with frozen albacore tuna too! Feel free to use any vegetables you want, as well as other types of thick steak fish such as albacore tuna. I buy my frozen fish for soups at Trader Joe's which are both affordable and very fresh!",
