    "summary": "With the rising prices of meat and my pocket book getting smaller and smaller, I have started to experiment with lentils and beans. It's cheap, easy, flavorful, and packed full of protein. Please note the dressing is to my taste so I would suggest tasting as you go. I have also substituted the vinegar with lime juice and the parsley with cilantro for a different flavor. Just play with whatever ingredients you have in the pantry!",
