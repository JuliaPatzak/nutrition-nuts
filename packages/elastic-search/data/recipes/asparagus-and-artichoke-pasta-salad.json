    "summary": "I threw this simple recipe together one night to use up some leftover chicken and asparagus. All quantities are approximate and can be adjusted according to your taste. Can easily be adjusted to include pasta salad favorites such as diced onions or celery (which, if I had had any, probably would have ended up in the bowl too!) A tasty way to use up your leftovers!",
