        "2\u2009\u00be cups milk",
        "1 cup white cornmeal",
        "2 tablespoons butter, softened",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "4 large eggs, separated",
        "1 tablespoon white sugar",
        "\u00bd teaspoon cream of tartar",

    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Grease an oven-proof cast iron Dutch oven or a deep baking dish",
        "Heat milk and cornmeal in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently, until thick and creamy, about 5 minutes",
        "Remove cornmeal mixture from heat and stir in butter and 1 teaspoon salt until well combined",
        "Beat egg yolks, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar together in a bowl until smooth; stir into cornmeal mixture",
        "Beat egg whites, 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar, and 1 pinch salt together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form",
        "Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak",
        "Gently fold egg white mixture into cornmeal mixture until well mixed and fluffy; pour into prepared Dutch oven",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown with a moist center, about 30 minutes",
        "Allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving"
