    "summary": "I've begun making my enchiladas casserole style, which saves a lot time, not to mention burned fingers. :) However, everyone still raves over my enchiladas, and this recipe recently earned a round of applause when I made them on a skiing holiday. The sauce is actually a modified Alfredo recipe and is also great over fajitas.",
