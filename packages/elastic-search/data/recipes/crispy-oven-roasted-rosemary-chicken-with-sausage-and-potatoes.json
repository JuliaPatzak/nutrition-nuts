    "summary": "I have had to adapt all my cooking to avoid anything that can induce heartburn. There are so many things I can't eat, I was about to despair of ever figuring out anything tasty I could cook. After much browsing, I came up with this fabulous recipe. All of my friends now make this recipe, so it's not just for heartburn sufferers! Of course, you can always add garlic or onion, but I guarantee you won't miss them! I usually use chicken thighs and the only sausage I can eat is bratwurst, but Italian would be yummy, of course.",
