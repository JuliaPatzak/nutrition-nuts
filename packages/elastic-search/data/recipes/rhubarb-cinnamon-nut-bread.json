        "In another bowl, beat egg with a fork; stir in milk and oil",
        "Add egg mixture to flour mixture",
        "Stir until just moistened; batter should be lumpy",
        "Fold in rhubarb",
        "Spoon 1/2 of the batter into prepared pan, then sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon mixture",
