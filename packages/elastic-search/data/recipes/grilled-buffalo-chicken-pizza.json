    "summary": "With spicy grilled chicken and cool, creamy dressing, this crispy flatbread pizza has all the flavors of a delicious Buffalo chicken sandwich. Juicy tomatoes and crisp lettuce give this dish a refreshing bite. I've been making this pizza for years and have yet to meet someone who doesn't love it. Garnish with pickled jalapenos, banana pepper rings, black olives, and blue cheese crumbles.",
