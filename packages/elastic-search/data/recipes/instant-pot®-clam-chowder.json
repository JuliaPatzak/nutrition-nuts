    "summary": "New England-style clam chowder is easy to make and is wonderful on those cold, chilly days. Serve with lots of crusty bread to soak up the last dredges in the bowl. I've chosen not to add any additional salt as the sodium content varies considerably between brands of clams. Taste and add salt at the end, if necessary.",
