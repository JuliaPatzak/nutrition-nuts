    "summary": "We were given a lot of strawberries and I had to figure out what to do with them so they didn't go bad. So I came up with this recipe. I hope everyone likes it as much as my kids did. I prefer fresh strawberries over strawberry extract because it gives it a more fruitful flavor. But the extract is good as well. You decide.",
