    "summary": "When you want a quick, easy dinner, nothing can beat shrimp to the table! The shrimp marinate in a tasty combination of flavors while the grill is preheating. The other dishes in your dinner need to be ready when the grill is, because the shrimp will only take about 4 minutes. Use this grilled shrimp as a main dish, with a side of yellow rice and a green veggie, or use them in yummy shrimp tacos, inside corn tortillas with your favorite toppings.",
