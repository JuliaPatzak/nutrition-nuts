    "summary": "Kolaches are a Czech recipe that are traditionally made with a yeast dough and fruit filling.  In this version a non-yeasted dough is used. Variations include:  cottage cheese, prune and apricot.  All are somewhat sweet and can be drizzled with a light powder sugar/milk frosting, but traditionally kolaches are not frosted.  I hope this is what you were looking for !!  If ever in Oklahoma, check out the Czech Festival in Yukon, OK.  The ladies of the community make about 2000 plus dozen Kolaches for sale during the festivities !!!",
