        "2 tablespoons butter",
        "\u00bd cup minced onion",
        "3 tablespoons minced garlic",
        "6 cups chicken stock",
        "1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste",

    "directions": [
        "Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat",
        "Cook and stir the onion and garlic in the butter until soft but not brown",
        "about 5 minutes",
        "Pour the chicken stock into the pot and whisk in the tomato paste, heavy cream, and lemon juice",
        "Turn the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil",
        "Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the 3 cups of pecan pieces and the chopped chipotle peppers, and simmer the soup until the pecans soften, about 30 minutes",
        "Set aside 2 cups of soup",
        "Pour the rest of the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the contents moving before leaving it on to puree",
        "Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot",
        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot",
        "Stir the reserved 2 cups of soup back into the pot and bring to a simmer and season with salt to taste",
        "Serve, hot, with a sprinkle of chopped pecans for garnish"
