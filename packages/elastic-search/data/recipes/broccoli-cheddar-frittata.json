    "summary": "A frittata is an excellent way to sneak veggies into your family's diet, and in this recipe, the veggie is broccoli. Also, thawed, diced hash brown potatoes speed up the cook time and the prep time, too. If you want more color on top of the frittata, shorten the baking time by a couple of minutes, and use the broiler to achieve the color you want. For breakfast or brunch, fresh fruit or baby tomatoes make a great side.",
