    "summary": "The coffee ice cream itself is addicting enough in this pie, but topping with a sweet, creamy, vanilla-y, coffee/booze-scented layer, I couldn't get enough. The espresso beans add pops of sweetness and bitterness and give this an amazing texture. Serve topped with an extra dollop of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry.",
