    "summary": "Shrimp, salt pork, and andouille sausage are sauteed with corn and bell peppers in a Jalapeno cream sauce; then tossed with penne pasta over individual pizza breads, and topped with crispy fried tortilla strips. Time-consuming, but well worth the effort, as your family or guests will admit. If you can find tasso, use it instead of salt pork.",
