    "summary": "This recipe is for marinated tofu. You can marinate the tofu in any marinade that you please. Barbecue, honey soy sauce, and honey mustard sauce are just three sauces that have been successful; be experimental!   You can cool the tofu and place in an air tight container in the fridge.  Makes a nice, chewy sandwich filling.  If the tofu is diced small and marinated with a smokey BBQ sauce, it can be used as a vegetarian replacement for pork in fried rice!",
