    "summary": "I was looking for new ways to use the fresh hard neck garlic scapes harvested from my garden and came up with this recipe. The family loved it. It's quick, easy, and nutritious. It will work for beef as well. Serve as is, or add sauce of choice (Thousand island dressing is a nice touch).",
