    "summary": "I got this from a neighbor while living in Germany and modified it a little. She was an American too. This was always a hit at every get-together we had! Fresh cranberries with jalapenos, sugar, green onions, and cilantro makes for great salsa. Add the cream cheese and you have a great dip! Serve with Ritz\u00ae crackers or Wheat Thins\u00ae.",
