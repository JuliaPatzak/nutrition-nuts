    "summary": "Simple zucchini puree for one of your baby's first foods. The rule of thumb is to give your baby a new food for 2 to 3 days before introducing another to rule out any potential allergies. Once you've given zucchini for 2 to 3 days, you can combine it with another vegetable you've already introduced, such as carrot.",
