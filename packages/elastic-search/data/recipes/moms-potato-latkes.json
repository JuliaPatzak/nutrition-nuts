    "summary": "Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must have at Hanukkah, but really are wonderful any time of year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best latke I've had. I usually end up having to make a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to these. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.",
