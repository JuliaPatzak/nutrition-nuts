    "summary": "This is one of those little gems of ingenuity from my Nana's kitchen. Nana always made this every Thanksgiving, and all of us kids took turns helping her make it. It is a simple dish, but it really hits the spot on a cold November day. I remember how my sister was absolutely shocked when she learned there was tuna in this dish. This is definitely a dish you'll want to make again and again.",
