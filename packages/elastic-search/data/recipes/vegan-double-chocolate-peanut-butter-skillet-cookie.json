    "summary": "I love baking and always feel badly that my vegan daughter can't eat a lot of what I make. She and I worked together to come up with this chocolate-peanut butter skillet cookie. It's super chocolaty and rich, and is much easier to cook it in one batch in a skillet than scooping on multiple cookie sheets.",

    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Whisk flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl",
        "Combine water and egg replacer in a small bowl",
        "Mix well and let sit until thickened, about 1 minute",

        "Mix in egg replacer and vanilla",
        "Gradually mix in dry ingredients until combined",
        "Fold in chocolate chips",
        "Transfer 1/2 of the dough into a well seasoned 10-inch cast iron skillet",
        "Press down with your fingers to distribute evenly over the bottom of the skillet",
        "Spread peanut butter over the dough",
        "Press remaining dough on top of the peanut butter; it's okay if some peanut butter is poking through",

        "Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing; cookie will firm up as it cools"
