    "summary": "This is a simple and good recipe that is great served on those hot summer days and can even be prepared the night before so that it is ready and cold when you come home from work the next day. My husband never ate this until we got married and in the summer he requests it every other week. You can substitute chicken for the tuna and it is great that way also. I serve it on a leaf of lettuce, for looks, with an assortment of crackers. Happy eating!",
