    "summary": "These Mediterranean-inspired chicken patties are a light contrast to your beef burgers and complement any backyard get-together. If you use all-breast meat, add some olive oil to the meat mixture so they don't dry out. You could also use 2 tablespoons chopped Kalamata olives instead of the tapenade. Use tzatziki sauce on top to stay with the Mediterranean flavors or use a sesame dressing with shredded lettuce for an Asian taste.",
