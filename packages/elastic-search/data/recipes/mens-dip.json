    "summary": "This is a hearty hot, spicy dip that is delicious with corn chips.  Tastes much different than you would imagine from the ingredients. Others who I have given this recipe to always want to leave out one ingredient or another.  I don't recommend doing this, at least not the first time you make it, as I feel every single one of the ingredients adds something to the flavor.",
