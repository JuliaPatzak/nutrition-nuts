    "summary": "I searched everywhere for a hearty breakfast muffin and had to invent my own in order to make it tasty and whole-wheat without loads of sugar or exotic ingredients. 100% whole-wheat. Almost no fat and very little sugar. But chocolatey and delicious. This is a very dense muffin that literally could replace a meal (if nuts are added).",
