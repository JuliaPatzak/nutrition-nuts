    "summary": "This stew will keep you warm and cozy on those cold winter days!! I got this recipe together after months of harassing my friends in New Mexico in search of the perfect green chile chicken stew. I make it at least once every month (I myself use a pressure cooker). Serve with warm flour tortillas. This recipe has a lot of chile peppers. Be sure to tone it down if you can't handle heat!",
