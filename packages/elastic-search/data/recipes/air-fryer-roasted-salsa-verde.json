    "summary": "This tomatillo salsa comes together quickly with the help of your air fryer. The tangy, zesty flavor can be tweaked to your preferred heat level--use only serranos for extra heat, or only jalapenos for a milder flavor. You could also leave some or all of the seeds in the peppers for an even spicier flavor or double the peppers! If you have an air fryer with a smaller basket, halve the recipe or roast the veggies in 2 batches.",
