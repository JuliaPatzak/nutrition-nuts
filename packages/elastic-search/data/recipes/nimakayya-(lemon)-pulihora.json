    "summary": "Lemon rice is a quick and tasty dish that you can make very quickly if you have cooked rice in the house. My mother used to make this for us when we came back from school or on Sundays for a quick lunch. It is delicious and very refreshing. Serve with some plain yoghurt or curds. If you want the sweet-salty taste, you can also add 1 teaspoon of sugar. My kids like it this way.",
