    "summary": "Tired of the same old, boring carrot cake?  THIS is the Carrot cake you'll love forever!  A little different because some of the ingredients aren't what you'd find in a 'normal' carrot cake.  My own MOTHER, who despises anything coconut, had two helpings for dessert and took some home!!  Don't knock it until you try it!!  You'll never go back to that boring recipe again.",
