    "summary": "Add some sweet/spicy flair to your appetizer spread! These zippy sausage balls use bulk Italian pork or turkey sausage and dried cranberries to use on a party buffet spread, or for watching the game. I just love finger foods that are just a bite or two, and these fill the bill. Add some extra heat with optional red pepper flakes, or dial down the heat and use sweet Italian sausage instead of the hot, if you prefer. Either way, you will enjoy the tangy sweetness the cranberries bring!",
