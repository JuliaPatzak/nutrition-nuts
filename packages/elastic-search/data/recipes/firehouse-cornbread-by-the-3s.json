    "summary": "I came up with this during my previous life as a firefighter after finding myself having to repeat my more popular recipes over and over. This one is easy to communicate and even easier to remember, since all of the measurements are in multiples of 3, which explains some of the more arcane measurements! A triple recipe, of course. I use this recipe both to serve with soup or chili, as well as the foundation for Nana's cornbread turkey stuffing. Enjoy!",
