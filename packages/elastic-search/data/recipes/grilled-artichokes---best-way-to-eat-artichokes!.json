    "summary": "Easy recipe for the non-culinary school folks who just like to eat artichokes. Boil and grill. This is a recipe from trial and error, so some culinary people may have issues with how long it's cooked, etc. But it's just, plain good this way. My wife and and I just can't eat artichokes any other way now. Read the recipe, then be sure to look at any comments for any improvement or preferable changes. Lawry's\u00ae isn't necessary, but adds some flavor.",
