    "summary": "This is one of my favorite baked potato recipes adapted for small appliances when a full kitchen isn't available.  Great for students or those waiting on their kitchen to finally finish being remodeled.  It's fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside and topped with pizza sauce and cheese.  It's tasty, cheap, quick, and easy.  You'll need a toaster oven and a microwave.",
