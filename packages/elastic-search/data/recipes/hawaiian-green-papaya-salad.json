    "summary": "This is my own version of a local favorite, papaya salad. It is wonderful to take to potluck or other gatherings, because it gets better with a few hours of resting time. 'Tis very nice with fresh ahi sashimi, brown rice, and a glass of icy Gewurztraminer. The sweetness of the wine softens the heat of the salad. Serve garnished with edible flowers or roasted sesame seeds.",
