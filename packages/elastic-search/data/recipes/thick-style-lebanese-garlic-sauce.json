    "summary": "This version is a fail-safe recipe that our family has perfected for the Lebanese Garlic Sauce. It can be used as a condiment on grilled meats, as a salad dressing, and in dishes that require good garlic flavor. We have found immersion blending works much better than using the blender. If you double the batch, don't double the salt, rather use 1 1/2 tablespoons.",
