    "summary": "My husband is from Kenya and I have had to learn new recipes and styles of cooking. This is one I invented myself. It is nice and light and fast to cook. Perfect for the summer. You can serve with white rice or the Kenyan staple food ugali. Ugali consists of simply boiling water and then adding white corn meal until texture is solid.",
