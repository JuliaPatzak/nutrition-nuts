    "summary": "I found this recipe and it sounded so good, but it served 100! I tweaked to serve 4 and use ingredients we like, and the results were great! I've got permission to make again, and I know I will. I love to use bone-in chicken thighs, but boneless breasts or thighs would work very well also.",
