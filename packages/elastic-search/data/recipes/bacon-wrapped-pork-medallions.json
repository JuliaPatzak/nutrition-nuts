        "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",

        "Remove any excess bacon grease from the skillet",
        "Combine garlic powder, seasoning salt, basil, and oregano in a small bowl",
        "Set aside",
        "Wrap the pork tenderloin with the bacon strips securing with 1 or 2 toothpicks per strip of bacon",
        "Slice the tenderloin between each bacon strip to create the medallions",
        "Dip both sides of the medallions in seasoning mix",
