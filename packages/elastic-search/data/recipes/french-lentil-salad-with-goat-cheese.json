    "summary": "Great side dish. French lentils (also called puy lentils) have a wonderful earthy flavor. You can't substitute regular green/brown lentils. They are expensive but usually affordable at your local food co-op. Goat cheese has a creamier texture than feta. I like to add grape tomatoes.",
