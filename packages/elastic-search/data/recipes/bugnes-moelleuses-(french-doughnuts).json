    "summary": "Bugnes are a doughnut-like pastry sprinkled with icing sugar that hail from Lyon. They're essential to Mardi Gras! A tradition that I never forget... making bugnes! I have loved them since I was a kid. My mother's bugnes (and now mine) have a little bit of lemon for a unique taste. Sprinkle with icing sugar before serving.",
