    "summary": "On the streets of Santa Maria, California, street vendors (think an ice cream man with a 'trash can' full of hot corn on the cob instead of ice cream) roam the sidewalks selling corn on the cob for a dollar an ear! They slide a wooden skewer in one end for you to hold the corn. We crave it often and it's become a regular on our Saturday grill nights! Give it a try. You'll be surprised!",
