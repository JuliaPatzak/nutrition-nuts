    "summary": "I lived above a Thai restaurant for a year in Sydney and they made the best green curry I've ever tasted. I was a regular customer and they even loaned me plates and bowls. I managed to persuade the chef to let me know how he made the curry. I've adapted it slightly to bring down the heat but it's still got a nice kick to it. Apparently the paste will keep in the fridge for up to 4 months! Serve immediately over fluffy jasmine rice.",
