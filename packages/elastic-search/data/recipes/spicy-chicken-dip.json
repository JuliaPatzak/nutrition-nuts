    "summary": "I came up with this dip when I was in the mood for Buffalo chicken dip, but didn't have the necessary ingredients. It is a creamy cheesy dip with a nice bit of back-end heat. I don't usually measure when I cook, so feel free to adjust any measurements to fit your taste. We ate this with sliced french bread, pretzels, and chips.",
