    "summary": "These lightly sweetened and buttery carrots are cooked to perfection using a sous vide immersion cooker. While it does take longer than other methods, the carrot flavor is much more pronounced because you're cooking the carrots in their own juices. They are finished under the broiler for extra caramelized sweetness. I like to use small carrots, sold in bunches with green tops attached; trim down the greens, and lightly scrub the carrots for a rustic look.",
