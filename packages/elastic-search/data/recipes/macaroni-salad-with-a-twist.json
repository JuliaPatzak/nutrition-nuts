    "summary": "I was messin' around in my kitchen trying to put a twist on my traditional macaroni salad recipe. I tried several different dishes before I came up with this one. Now my friends and family can't get enough of it! I recommend making it a day ahead and chilling it overnight to really develop the flavors.",
