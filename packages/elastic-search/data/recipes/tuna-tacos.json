    "summary": "This is a tuna taco recipe I created 25 years ago. It is easy, quick, and very tasty. When served with crackers it makes a really good light snack or appetizer. I find that once you start eating them you really can't stop. I like to serve this with a chicken rice. To lighten the recipe, you can eat with crackers.",
