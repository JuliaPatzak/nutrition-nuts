    "summary": "This is my mom's recipe that's been in our family for 30+ years. It is a hit everywhere and is literally the first dish gone. I make it for potlucks, holidays, football games, or a meal/appetizer at home. Although I consider this a somewhat advanced recipe, it is easy to master. It is my most-requested recipe! Serve alongside your favorite marinara sauce. Freezes very well!!",
