    "summary": "A version of this recipe circulates online as Matthew's Delicious Tofu. It has ginger and less lemon. I like it better the way I make it. It's one of the few dishes where I use lemon juice but not the zest. I'm not really going for the lemon flavor as much as the tartness. In fact, you could use rice vinegar instead if that's what you've got.",
