    "summary": "This was simply a case of me wanting hummus, not having garbanzo beans, and making it anyway with sweet potatoes. I don't blame you if you're skeptical, but this stuff has the same taste and texture as hummus, just with a slightly sweet finish reminiscent of red pepper hummus. My wife, Michele, who has a much more discerning palate than I do, said that if blindfolded, she'd have trouble distinguishing this from real hummus.",
