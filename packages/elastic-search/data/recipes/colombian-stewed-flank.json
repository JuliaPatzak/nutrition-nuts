    "summary": "This wonderful dish has so much flavor. It reminds me of the great flavors of Colombian cooking. Slow-cooked, simmered steak makes this dish so tender and juicy! If you desire some heat, like I do, add a jalapeno pepper. You can also substitute beer for half the water for another variation on the flavor. Serve over rice or with tortillas.",
