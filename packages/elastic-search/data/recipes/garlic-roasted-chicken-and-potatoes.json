    "summary": "I've been making this recipe for so many years, I can't remember where I got it from.  It's really quick to throw together.  After fixing it several times, my husband 'discovered' that you were supposed to spread the garlic on the chicken. It's one of his favorites now. This recipe is very easy to adjust up or down.  Just make sure your pan is big enough if adjusting up.  I usually add more potatoes, since we like them.  Serve with a mixed greens salad.",
