    "summary": "This is a classic and very simple technique for homemade vegetable soups. I'm using broccoli, but almost any vegetable will work. I am a disciple of the Gordon Ramsey school of vegetable soups. It's basically the vegetable, some stock or water, cooked until tender, pureed, and seasoned simply. His 'crazy' theory is that the star of the bowl should be the featured vegetable itself.",
