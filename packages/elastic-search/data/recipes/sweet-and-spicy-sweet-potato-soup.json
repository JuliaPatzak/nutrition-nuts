    "summary": "A creamy fall soup that's easy to make any time of year. The earthiness of the sweet potato is balanced with tart apples, spicy ginger, and touch of zesty lime. If desired, garnish each serving with a dollop of sour cream, some chopped cilantro, and a few sweet, spicy nuts. A Thanksgiving favorite that's a kid favorite year-round. Freezes well!",
