    "summary": "This is a favorite of the men at parties. The first time I made them they were gone in a matter of minutes. These can be kept frozen in baggies until you are ready to serve them. When it is party time, take them out of the freezer, thaw for about one hour, then pop them in an oven for about 20 minutes until they are warm. Serve with BBQ sauce, honey mustard, and salsa for dipping.",
