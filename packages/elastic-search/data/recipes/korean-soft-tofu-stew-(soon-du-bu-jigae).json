    "summary": "This is an easy and authentic version of Korean tofu stew. I used to eat this every day at a very popular restaurant. I befriended a woman who worked there and she gave me the recipe. It's very versatile. Small pieces of meat or seafood can be added. It's thick and great in the winter and can be made very mild or very spicy. I've seen some recipes on the internet for this dish that are the American version. They may be good too but this one is authentic.",
