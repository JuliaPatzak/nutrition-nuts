    "summary": "The 'ancient grain' spelt is related to modern wheat, but it's actually an entirely different species. From what I hear, it's easier to digest, higher in protein and fiber, and to me at least, has a much better flavor and texture than other whole-wheat flours. Top with favorite pizza toppings!",
