    "summary": "When I can't get kosher meat, I simply do without but today I just craved something meaty. I had a pack of extra-firm tofu in the fridge and this is what I did with it. Baking the tofu before frying helps to crisp it up and imparts the meatiness I was seeking. My BFF thought it was fish at first glance. He is not into foreign foods but he was very enthusiastic about these yummy little bites when served with dipping sauce.",
