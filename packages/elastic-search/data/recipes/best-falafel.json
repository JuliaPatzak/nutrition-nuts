    "summary": "Sure, you can make falafel from a mix but frankly, it's a far cry from authentic falafel. This is the best falafel recipe I know of. You can find dried fava beans in Middle Eastern grocery stores and some supermarkets. Serve with pita bread, tahini sauce, lettuce, and other chopped vegetables.",

        "Drain beans and chickpeas and rinse under cold running water; drain again",
        "Remove the skins from the fava beans and discard them",
        "Do not skip that step or the falafel will not taste good",
        "Combine fava beans, chickpeas, onion, garlic, and parsley leaves in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until pureed, scraping the sides often to ensure everything is evenly processed to a smooth paste",
        "Add cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, baking soda, salt, and pepper",
        "Transfer to a bowl; cover and let mixture rest for 30 minutes",
        "Line a baking sheet or a large tray with waxed paper",

        "Heat until oil is hot enough to sizzle a breadcrumb",
        "Carefully lift the falafel from the waxed paper using a spatula",
        "Fry a few falafel at a time and do not overcrowd the skillet",
        "Fry until crisp and brown on the underside, 3 to 5 minutes",
        "Flip, and fry on the other side until browned, another 3 to 5 minutes",
        "Remove from skillet and transfer to a baking sheet",
        "Place the finished falafel in the preheated oven to keep warm while you fry the rest, adding more oil to the pan as needed"
