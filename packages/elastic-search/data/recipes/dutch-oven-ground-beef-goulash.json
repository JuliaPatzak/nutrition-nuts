    "summary": "This is a smoky, rich, Dutch oven goulash. The cavatappi pasta captures large amounts of this great paprika sauce. While the red pepper and lemon, added towards the end of cooking, add a little freshness which helps balance the sauce. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some chives.",
