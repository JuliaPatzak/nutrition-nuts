    "summary": "I have been making these for years. I used to make them in bread form, but having 7 children it was just easier to dole out a muffin than cut up the messy loaf. I also began giving these out as Christmas food gifts. This was requested by my 17-year-old son for our dessert we have to bring to his football banquet. My 21-year-old daughter who moved to Ogden, Utah with her husband and 2 kids wants to make these muffins for her in-laws who will be spending the Thanksgiving holidays with them.",
