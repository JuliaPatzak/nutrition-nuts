    "summary": "Easy soup to make using ingredients that I always have on hand.  My husband loves this stuff.  He likes to put a big spoonful of leftover mashed potatoes in the bowl and cover it with the soup.  I like it served with corn chips and grated cheese. For a spicier soup, add a few diced jalapenos.",
