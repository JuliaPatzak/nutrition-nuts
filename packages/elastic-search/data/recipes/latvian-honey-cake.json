    "summary": "It's one of the most popular Latvian cakes \u2013 simple and delicious! It requires a little work but it's definitely worth it! I've made it several times and my preparation skills are improving with every time. Don't get scared away because of the sour cream, it matches perfectly with the sweet honey taste. The cake tastes the best after it's kept overnight in the refrigerator, the flavors will blend together nicely.  I use a 9x13 inch baking pan, but another similar size will do.",
