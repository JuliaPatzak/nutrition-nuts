    "summary": "This is a recipe I created when I realized that our bottled salad dressing was frozen and couldn't thaw quickly enough. It is very easy to make from ingredients usually already on hand. You can vary the amounts, or even substitute low-fat ingredients according to your personal taste. Tastes even better when chilled over night!",
