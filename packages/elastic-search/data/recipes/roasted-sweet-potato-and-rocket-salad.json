    "summary": "I had this salad at a once popular New-American restaurant in Jersey City, but it's no longer in business. The restaurant used a house-made Romesco dressing, but I made my own roasted red bell pepper dressing that also complements the peppery rocket leaves, also known as baby arugula. It makes a great appetizer or a side to a nice entree.",
