    "summary": "This is an excellent recipe for real ceviche. For those of you who love ceviche, you know that good ceviche takes a little effort. I use the freshest seafood and produce from the local fine food market. For those of you who are not familiar with ceviche, it is an extremely refreshing cold seafood soup. It may sound weird, but it is awesome! Serve in half-orange bowl or martini glass.",
