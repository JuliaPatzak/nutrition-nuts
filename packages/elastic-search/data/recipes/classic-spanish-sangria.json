    "summary": "This is an authentic version of the popular wine drink.  You can add any fruit that you want, but I find that apples and pears absorb all the rum.  This one is not diluted with carbonated beverages.  I have much success with red Burgundy wine and white rum, though spiced rum is nice too.",
