    "summary": "I wanted a really easy way to fix fish, so I came up with this recipe.  Just mix it up and store in your pantry.  Season fish, then either bake or grill.  I like to mix it with a little olive oil and spread over salmon filets, then bake it in the oven. This blend of herbs goes really well with fish, yet does not overpower it.",
