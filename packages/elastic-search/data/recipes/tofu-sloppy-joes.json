    "summary": "My veggie version of an American favorite made with tofu. My boyfriend who recently turned vegetarian loved them and said the sauce was even better than store-bought. Hope you enjoy these tofu Sloppy Joes as much as we did! This recipe yields a lot of Sloppy Joe mix and is even better the next day. I serve these with a side of fresh corn on the cob and a salad.",
