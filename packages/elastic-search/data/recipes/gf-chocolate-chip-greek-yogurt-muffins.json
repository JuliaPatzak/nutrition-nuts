    "summary": "Easy and fast. Rich but not too rich, using Greek yogurt. Sweet, but not too sweet. Using coconut sugar is a lower-glycemic alternative to sugar. Or so I've read. Deep-dark and satisfying for the choc-o-holics in all of us. A recipe I have worked over and over to perfect. This being the best thus far. Best when cooled down and chips have firmed again. Depends on your likes.",
