    "summary": "I just had to share my favorite dessert of all time, in the hopes of keeping the Valentine's Day fire on: the Mexican churro with cinnamon-cardamom sugar and dark chocolate dip. Plus a fragrant spin with cardamom and star anise in the mix--familiar with a heady hint of exotic! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, all smothered with a sinfully dark chocolate sauce.",

        "Bring water to a boil in a medium-sized pot",
        "Add vegetable oil, sugar, and salt",
        "Stir to combine",
        "Add flour and turn off heat",
        "Stir continuously and vigorously with a wooden spoon until dough balls up and follows your spoon around the pan, 1 to 2 minutes",
        "Set aside to cool when dough feels firm and supple",
        "Heat 3/4- to 1 inch of grapeseed oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat",
