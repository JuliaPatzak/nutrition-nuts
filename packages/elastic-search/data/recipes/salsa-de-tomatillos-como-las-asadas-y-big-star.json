    "ingredients": [
        "10  fresh tomatillos, husks removed",
        "3 cloves garlic",
        "1 cup water",
        "4  serrano chiles, stemmed",
        "2  poblano chiles, stemmed",

    ],
    "directions": [
        "Bring the tomatillos, garlic cloves, and water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the tomatillos have lost their shape, 15 to 20 minutes",
        "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source",
        "Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil",
        "Cut the serrano peppers and poblano peppers in half from top to bottom; remove the stem, seeds, and ribs, then place the peppers cut-side-down onto the prepared baking sheet",
        "Cook under the preheated broiler until about 3/4 of the skin has blackened and blistered, 3 to 5 minutes",
        "Place the blackened peppers into a bowl, and tightly seal with plastic wrap",
        "Allow the peppers to steam for 5 to 7 minutes",

        "Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat",
        "Stir in the yellow onion, and cook until the onion has softened and is beginning to turn brown, 7 to 10 minutes",
        "Place the yellow onions into a blender along with the tomatillo mixture",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the salsa moving before leaving it on to puree",
        "Puree until no large chunks remain",
        "Return to the skillet, and simmer over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes until the salsa thickens slightly",
        "Pour into a bowl, and cool to room temperature",
        "Once cool, stir in the salt, cilantro, red onion, and lime juice to serve"
