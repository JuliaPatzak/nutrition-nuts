    "summary": "I am married to a chef, but I can't cook. So I make a lot of food in my slow cooker when it's my night to cook. We love France and French cooking, and this recipe is a wonderfully simple, elegant cassoulet that even I can make and he loves. Wonderful for cold nights and dinner parties. Double the recipe for leftovers - it melds overnight very well.",
