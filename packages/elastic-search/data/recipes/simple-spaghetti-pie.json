    "summary": "I absolutely love how easily this spaghetti pie jazzes up a simple Italian meal. This is my ultimate dish I make whenever guests come over. Every guest has requested this recipe. Very versatile to suit your style/taste. You can halve the recipe and put it in the 8x8 pan. I usually don't measure the ingredients for the layers; I just eye it to my taste. I like the sauce cooked separately, to allow for flexibility in serving. Feel free to experiment !",
