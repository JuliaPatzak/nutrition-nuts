    "summary": "Fresh salmon and fresh veggies, that you probably have in your fridge, make up this easy salad. Fresh salmon takes approximately the same amount of time to cook as the pasta but go with canned if that's what you have on hand.  Growing up by the sea, I've eaten a fair amount of salmon and pasta salad; this is a combination of many recipes that I've tried.",
