    "summary": "Crunchy, thin breadsticks made with buckwheat flour and butter to give your appetizers or salads a new twist. Grissini are long, crunchy breadsticks from Torino, usually made with lard or oil. The butter lends a soft interior and a crunchy exterior while bursting with a creamy, buttery flavor. These are perfect for serving with prosciutto, olives, and your favorite cheeses, or just on their own. They are so easy to make. You can make them at the last minute but they also store well, so they can even be made a few days ahead of time. If there are leftovers, do not put them in an airtight container. Wrap them in a cloth or parchment paper for a day or two. The crunchier they are, the better.",
