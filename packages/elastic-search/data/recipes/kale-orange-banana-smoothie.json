    "summary": "Sometimes it tastes like Fruit Loops\u00ae cereal, but, of course, this is actually good for you. My 14-month-old loves this for breakfast. Furthermore, he can feed himself (with a sippy cup) while I make breakfast and lunch for the older kids. The texture is similar to pudding. If runnier texture is desired, add ice or milk.",
