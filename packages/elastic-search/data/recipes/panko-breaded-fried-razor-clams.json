    "summary": "I grew up on the West Coast where these tasty little treats are found. You can vary the amount of ingredients used in the recipe according to the number of clams you have, but be sure to use real Parmesan cheese and only panko crumbs, not regular bread crumbs. Pound the necks with a meat tenderizer, or deep fry them, if desired. These are delicious!!!",
