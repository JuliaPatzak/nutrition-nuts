    "summary": "I'm really excited to show you this recipe, not only because it's one of the best beef stews ever, but also because after we enjoy this in stew form, we're doing a follow-up video using this to make some of the most incredible tacos you've ever had. If you like beef stew, and you're a fan of chili, you're going to go nuts over this. Serve with lime wedges as-is, or with warm flour tortillas, chili oil, salsa, or diced avocado next to some Spanish rice and a nice green salad.",
