    "summary": "This meal isn't fat free, but it is a recipe that I serve at least once per month anyhow. :D. It's a great dish on its own, but I normally serve it up with some fresh Italian bread and basil-flavored olive oil for dipping. Wicked yummy pasta, people!!  Serve this with a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan cheese on the side, so that people can decide how much they feel like using.",
