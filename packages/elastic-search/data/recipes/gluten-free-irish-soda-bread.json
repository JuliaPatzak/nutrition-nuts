    "summary": "Searching for recipes for a gluten-free diet can be challenging during the holidays.  Here is a recipe for Irish soda bread that I have adapted over time for St. Patrick's Day.  The recipe calls for rice and tapioca flour instead of wheat and it still tastes yummy!  Good if wrapped and left overnight, but I think it tastes great right out of the oven. Serve with butter or jam.",
