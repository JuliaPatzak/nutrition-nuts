    "summary": "Welcome to one of this country's most delicious unknown sandwiches, the Beef on Weck. This simple but brilliant creation features thinly sliced, horseradish-covered roast beef piled high on a freshly baked kummelweck roll. When you add a steaming ramekin of fresh beef jus for dunking, you'll understand why this is the pride of Western New York (sorry, chicken wings). Serve with chips or fries and pickles on the side.",
