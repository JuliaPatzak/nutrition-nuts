    "summary": "Don't pass up those day-old doughnuts in the grocery store. They make great bread pudding! Just about any kind of raised yeast doughnuts work except for jelly. Apple fritters are even good. I sometimes use a combination of cinnamon, glazed, sugared doughnuts and apple fritters for an interesting combination. You don't have to add any extra fat and very little (if any) extra sugar depending on taste.",
