    "summary": "This is an amazing recipe for a creamy, cheesy spinach-artichoke dip, without the excess oil! I made this recipe because I wanted the perfect combination. It has the perfect amount of spice without being too overpowering, and is made without mayonnaise, so you don't get the oiliness that some other dips may have. I love to serve this with toasted sourdough bread.",
