    "summary": "In my husband's family, we have a tradition of making a variety of appetizers as our meal for Christmas Eve. My sister-in-law brought these one year and they have been one of our favorites ever since. I don't generally use the large stuffing mushrooms, though you can if you're serving this as a first or second course in a formal dinner. Instead I use regular button mushrooms so 15 or so people can have two or three each.",
