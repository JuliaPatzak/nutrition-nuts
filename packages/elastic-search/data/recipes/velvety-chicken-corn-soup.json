    "summary": "This is a quick and easy way to make this soup that is usually served at Chinese restaurants.  For a tangy/hot flavor try this: about 3 to 4 hours before serving combine 1/4 cup vinegar and 3 finely chopped green chilies. Refrigerate until serving time and then sprinkle about a teaspoon of this on the soup.  Enjoy!! Garnish with fresh scallions.",
