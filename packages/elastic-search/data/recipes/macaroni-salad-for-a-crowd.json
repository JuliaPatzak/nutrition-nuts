    "summary": "Basic and super easy macaroni salad that I make for family gatherings. I make mine with dill relish but you could change it if you prefer the sweet. Looks good and tastes even better the next day. The more you make it, the quicker you will get. Can be served right away, or make it ahead of time and keep it in the fridge.",
