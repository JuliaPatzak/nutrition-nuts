    "summary": "I looked for a recipe for glazed salmon and didn't find one that used the ingredients I had on hand. So I threw together what I had and came up with this tangy, spicy sweet marinade that adds flavor, but doesn't mask the flavor of the salmon. My kids and sister loved it.  They said it was better than 'restaurant salmon' It's great served with wild rice and stir fried veggies.",
