    "summary": "This is a healthier, creamy alternative to store-bought peanut butter. It is a combination of many different types of nuts so you can mix and match according to your tastes and preferences. I personally like to make it with walnuts, almonds, and pistachios. It is also low in sugar. Great for a healthy snack option pre or post workout.",
