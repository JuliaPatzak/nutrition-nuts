    "summary": "This is my version of spaghetti lobster. It can be served as an appetizer or entree. Marinated chicken, shrimp, scallops, etc. can be used in place of lobster to make the meal more affordable to people on a budget. Using Holland House\u00ae cooking wine as a substitute also works surprisingly well.",
