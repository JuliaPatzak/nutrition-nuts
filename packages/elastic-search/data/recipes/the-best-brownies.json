    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Butter an 8-inch square baking dish or pan, then line with parchment paper if desired to make getting the brownies out easier",

        "Turn off the heat and set aside",
        "Mix sugar and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric hand mixer until very airy, thick, and creamy, about 5 minutes",

        "Dump in the flour mixture and mix on low speed just until the flour disappears",
        "Use a spatula to transfer the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread as evenly as possible",
