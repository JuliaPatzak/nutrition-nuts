    "summary": "Either way, now is when I look for ways to make our heirloom tomatoes the star of any dish I use them in. That's the case with this dish. The tomatoes were firm and sweet, with just the hint of acidity from the lemon juice, countered by the tang of onion and the creaminess of the dressing and goat cheese crumbles. Nancy and I both went back for seconds and she finished off the leftovers the next day before I could even get home!",
