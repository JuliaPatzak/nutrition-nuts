    "summary": "This is a quick but company-worthy cobbler. So simple, yet wins rave reviews.  If desired, use 2 (32 ounce) cans of peaches in place of fresh peaches. If doing this, use peach syrup instead of water and then omit the white sugar from recipe. Also, yellow cake mix can be substituted for the white.",
