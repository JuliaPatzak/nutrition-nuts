    "summary": "Pimiento cheese spread is one of those Southern comfort foods that doubles as a really delicious appetizer. If solace is what you're seeking, use the spread to make a sandwich on white bread, or grill it a la grilled cheese. If an appetizer is what you need, put it in a bowl and serve it on toast points or with crackers and celery sticks.",
