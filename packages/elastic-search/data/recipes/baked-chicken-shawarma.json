    "summary": "Middle Eastern foods rely on an abundance of spices and seasonings to create richly flavored food. Shawarma usually involves a stack of meat on a grill, but this recipe calls for a layer of chicken thighs on a sheet pan, in the oven. Use the broiler briefly, at the end of the baking time, to achieve extra flavor from the light char. Chicken can be served on steamed white rice, or sliced and served in a pita or flatbread with tomatoes, lettuce, and your favorite tzatziki or tahini sauce.",
