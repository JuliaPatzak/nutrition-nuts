    "summary": "As I researched the health benefits of pumpkin seeds I discovered that not only did they have lots of nutritional benefits, but contained large amounts of tryptophan. Yes, that tryptophan, the 'turkey valium' you read about every year. I've always wanted to try them instead of pine nuts on various recipes. Little did I know I was really inventing an alternative medicinal treatment.",
