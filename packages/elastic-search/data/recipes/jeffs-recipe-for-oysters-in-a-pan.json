    "summary": "This recipe is great as an appetizer served over crackers or sliced toasted French bread. Also, the dish can be poured over pasta if enough gravy is made. This recipe has the basic ingredients. You should make the sauce as thick as you like. Never use cold water when thickening any gravy or roux. It will ruin the bond between the flour and oil.",
