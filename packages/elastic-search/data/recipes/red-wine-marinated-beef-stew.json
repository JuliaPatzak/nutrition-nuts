    "summary": "A twist on traditional beef stew--stew meat that is so tender even the most finicky eaters will love! (i.e. kids that don't like meat that is tough to chew...like mine.) The \"secret\" is the acid from the red wine. It helps to break down the collagen, naturally tenderizing the meat and releasing great flavor! The longer you can marinate the better but a minimum of 3 hours is essential. Enjoy with a good crusty bread and a glass of red!",
