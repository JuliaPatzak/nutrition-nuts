    "summary": "Most compotes call for excessive amounts of sugar, making them rather calorie laden. This recipe takes advantage of natural ingredients allowing, for the simple goodness of the strawberries' sweetness to shine through. This can be used as an ice cream topping, or a topping for pancakes, waffles, or French toast. Feel free to also use it in pastries.",
