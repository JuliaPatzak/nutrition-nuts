    "summary": "You might feel like making lasagna in a pressure cooker is crazy. Don't you need an oven for those crunchy edges? To make sure the meat is cooked through? How can anyone make lasagna without baking it? Well, trust us - this one is well worth making. If you have a 6- or 7-inch springform pan and you kept the trivet that came with your Instant Pot\u00ae, you can make a delicious layered lasagna pie in 30 minutes. And if you want to make it ahead, you can prep the lasagna, put it in the freezer, then put it right into the Instant Pot\u00ae for an easy dinner.",
