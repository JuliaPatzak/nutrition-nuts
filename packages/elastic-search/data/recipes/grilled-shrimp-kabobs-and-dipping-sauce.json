    "summary": "This recipe was inspired by my husband. He is Mexican so he has taught me to play with different flavors and ingredients, though the recipe idea came from a karaoke bar that served spicy shrimp one night. I thought this would be a perfect kabob recipe for indoor/outdoor entertaining. It is getting close to summer again and grilling is the best way to entertain this season.",
