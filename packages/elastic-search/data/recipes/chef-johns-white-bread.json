    "summary": "I mostly eat whole grain breads but occasionally will indulge in some white, which if we're being honest, really is a more special bread-eating experience, especially for sandwiches. The buttery, slightly sweet, but mostly neutral flavor of white bread really lets the main ingredients shine. So, whether you're a nostalgic baby boomer like me, or just a curious millennial 'wondering' what a classic white bread tastes like, I really do hope you give this a try soon.",
