    "summary": "This recipe was given to me by a close friend. I was headed to a bacon party and the dessert list was quite limited.  These cupcakes were eaten before the entrees and disappeared quickly! The bacon is the clincher. It is a must and the buttermilk in the batter makes it taste amazing.",
