    "summary": "Using instant potato flakes and an instant pancake mix for my starter, I'm always ready for my B-and-B guests. Works great if you're cooking for 2 or 20. Great by themselves -- or top with bacon, poached egg, and cheese (we like applesauce on the side, also.) Great finger food, just fold it over a slice of cheese or bacon.",
