    "summary": "A delicious quiche-like tart with chanterelles that has a slightly firmer texture due to the chevre, and an earthy nuttiness that comes from the ground hazelnuts in the tart shell. Pairs perfectly with a small mixed salad that has been simply dressed with a light vinaigrette. A small amount of chevre crumbled over the top of the wedges of tart along with few extra sauteed mushrooms amps up the flavors in the tart and makes a nice presentation.",
