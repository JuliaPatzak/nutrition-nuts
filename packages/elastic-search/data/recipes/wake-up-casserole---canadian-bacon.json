    "summary": "The original recipe is delicious, but this is my healthier version, with less fat and calories. It also freezes beautifully and individual portions can be reheated in 3 minutes in the microwave. As a single person, I can't eat 8 portions at one sitting, so I divide and freeze. But it's great if family visits, because I can have the portions ready to reheat, and it's also great if you're in a hurry in the morning and don't have time to cook before heading off to work.",
