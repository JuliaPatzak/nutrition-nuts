    "summary": "This confetti rice salad recipe might appear to require lots of slicing and dicing, but truth be told, all the veggies can probably be prepped in less than 15 minutes. In fact, this would be a great recipe to set your benchmark, and then see how you improve over time. Or, just use a food processor to chop everything. Either way, this make-ahead dish will enliven any celebration with its delightful colors.",
