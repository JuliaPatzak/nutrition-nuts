    "summary": "This jam recipe has been tossed around my family for three generations and has never failed to work/turn out and is yummy no matter what we add to it! There are so many ways to change and add to it that any person in your family will love it. It also works well using strawberries and rhubarb together or any other berry you can think of instead of mulberries. The preserves may look runny or thin on the cupboard shelf, but once in the fridge they thicken up nicely.  Enjoy!",
