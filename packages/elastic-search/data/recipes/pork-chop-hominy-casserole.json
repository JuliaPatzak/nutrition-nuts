    "summary": "My mom used to make this. I don't know where she got the recipe. My husband and kids don't like hominy (corn's big cousin) but they love this. Mom tried to make it several times, but every time she opened the can of hominy, there were pork and beans inside, so she would say 'Well kids, it's beans again tonight!'",
