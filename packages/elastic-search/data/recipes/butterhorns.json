        "Crumble the compressed yeast into a small bowl, and mix in 2 teaspoons of sugar",
        "Set aside",
        "In a small saucepan, heat milk until a skin forms on the top",
        "Remove from heat, and set aside to cool slightly",
        "Place 1 cup of butter and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar into a large bowl",
        "Pour the hot milk over them, and stir until butter is melted",
        "Let the mixture cool to just above body temperature",
        "Beat in the eggs, one at a time mixing well after each one, then stir in the yeast mixture",
        "Add 3 cups of flour, and mix until well blended",
        "Gradually mix in the remaining flour, mixing as well as you can",
        "The dough will be sticky",
        "Cover the bowl with a towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour",
        "After the dough has risen, punch down, cover, and refrigerate overnight",
        "Divide the dough into four pieces",
        "Use one piece at a time, leaving the rest in the refrigerator",
        "On a lightly floured surface, roll the piece of dough out into a 12 inch circle",
        "Spread about 2 tablespoons of butter over the surface",
        "Cut into 8 wedges, as you would a pizza",
        "Roll each wedge starting at the wide end, and ending at the point",
        "Place onto a lightly greased cookie sheet, and bend the ends so that they are crescent shaped",
        "Cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled",
        "This will take about 2 hours because the dough is cold",
        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden"
