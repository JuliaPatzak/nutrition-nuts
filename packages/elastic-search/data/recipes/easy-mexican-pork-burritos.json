    "summary": "Pork butt roast and taco or burrito seasoning are a combination to die for! This recipe originally came from my Aunt Pennie. I've tweaked it to our liking though. My whole family loves these! When we have friends over for dinner, this is the perfect meal to prepare. I usually make about 20-24 burritos from one batch of filling. Serve with lettuce, tomato, green onion, sour cream, salsa, avocado, black olives, and Cheddar cheese, if desired.",
