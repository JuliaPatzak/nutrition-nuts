    "summary": "I was looking for a muffin or quick bread recipe that called for yogurt but all were a bit too wholesome for me so I dreamed up this dried cherry bread. But at least I kept the oats! I am sure this batter could be used to make muffins too. A streusel topping or powdered sugar glaze would be extra naughty and extra good too but I didn't want to be too naughty.",
