    "summary": "Either blind bake a 9-inch crust, or use a graham cracker or chocolate cookie crust, and create the rest of this luscious pie on top of the stove! No need to bake the filling, this pudding pie combines the flavors of dark chocolate and pumpkin in a rich and satisfying dessert. Add some pretty sliced almonds or toasted pecans to the top if you want to add some extra crunch. This recipe is easy to personalize!",
