    "summary": "This is a updated version of my mom's pork chops with cream of mushroom soup. I don't care for the canned soup due to the high sodium. I use cream, mushrooms, onions and bourbon along with beef stock to make a sauce that is out of this world. I like to serve this with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.",
