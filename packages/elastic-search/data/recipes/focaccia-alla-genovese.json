        "Place 1/2 cup warm water in a small bowl, and sprinkle yeast over the surface",

        "Stir together using a sturdy wooden spoon",
        "When the dough comes together, turn out onto a floured surface, and knead vigorously for about 20 minutes",

        "Turn to coat the ball with oil",

        "Mist with water",
        "Sprinkle a little cornmeal over the surface of the baking stone",
        "Slide the square off of the peel onto the baking stone",
        "Mist some water into the hot oven, and quickly shut the door",
