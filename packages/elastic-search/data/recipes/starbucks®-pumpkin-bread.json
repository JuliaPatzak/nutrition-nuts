    "summary": "A thick slice of moist pumpkin bread Starbucks\u00ae-style is the perfect companion for your morning cup of joe! Many other pumpkin bread recipes produce sad, squat loaves - but not this clone. Here's a custom formula that makes enough batter to fill up a medium loaf pan. And when the bread is done, you'll slice the beefy loaf into eight thick square hunks of goodness that perfectly mimic the weight, color and flavor of the real thing.",
