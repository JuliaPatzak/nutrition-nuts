    "summary": "This recipe was originally a higher-fat recipe. But with age and ailments comes restraint and tradeoffs. To try the original recipe, use butter instead of extra-virgin olive oil and whole milk instead of skim. I am not much of a celery fan, especially in mild-flavored foods, but if you like celery, add small diced celery to taste along with the onion, garlic and potato. Serve with crackers of choice. I personally don't use crackers. I feel they detract from enjoying the mild desired flavor and creamy dreaminess.",
