        "Fold into chocolate mixture, then fold in cake flour, until incorporated",
        "Pour into prepared springform pan, and smooth the top",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out dry, about 45 minutes",
        "Cool pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then run a small knife around the edge and remove the sides of the pan",
        "Allow cake to cool completely on the base of the pan",
        "When cool, remove from pan, and remove parchment paper; slice cake in half horizontally",

        "Brush the outside of the cake with the remaining syrup, then spread remaining apricot preserves over the top and sides; refrigerate until the icing is ready",
        "To make the icing, melt 9 ounces of chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave until smooth",
        "Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan, then stir into melted chocolate",
        "Cool slightly, stirring often, until the chocolate reaches a spreadable consistency",
        "Set the cake on a cooling rack set over a cookie sheet or waxed paper to catch any drips",
        "Pour the icing on top of the cake, and spread around the edges; allow excess icing to drip through the rack",
        "Cool cake to room temperature, then carefully remove from the cooling rack using a spatula",
        "Transfer to a dessert plate and store in the refrigerator",
        "Allow cake to come to room temperature before serving"
