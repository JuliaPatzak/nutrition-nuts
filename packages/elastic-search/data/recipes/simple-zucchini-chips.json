    "summary": "If you're looking for a low-fat snack that's easy to make and tastes delicious, then this recipe is perfect for you. We'd recommend using a mandoline to slice the zucchini as you want them as thin as possible to make them nice and crispy. If not, you can use a knife too. You'll know when the chips are ready as they'll start to curl up and harden.",
