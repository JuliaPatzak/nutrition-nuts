    "summary": "I made these when I had my bar, and they were always a big hit. I made them in large batches because of the standing time, but have scaled the recipe for home use. Extra large eggs are boiled, then pickled in a simple brine solution. For a variation, add dry minced onion flakes, crushed red pepper or hot sauce to the brine.",
