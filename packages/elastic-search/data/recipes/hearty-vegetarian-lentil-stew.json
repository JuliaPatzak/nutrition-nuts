    "summary": "A hearty vegetarian lentil stew that's delicious, inexpensive, and goes a long way. Even if you're not a vegetarian, it makes a fulfilling, delicious meal. A nice crusty bread goes well on the side. Great to bring to work. This is a bulk recipe that keeps well refrigerated and reheats very nicely. Don't be afraid to scale down if need be.",
