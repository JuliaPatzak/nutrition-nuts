    "summary": "I got some butternut squash and cranberries (both I am not fond of) in my 'Bountiful Basket' last week. Not having a clue what to do with them, I came up with this surprisingly yummy muffin. I made up this recipe with what I had on hand. It is really very light, tasty, and not too sweet. I serve mine with honey or sweetened cream cheese. If possible, always choose organic.",
