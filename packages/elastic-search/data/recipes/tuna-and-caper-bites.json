    "summary": "One weekend while camping, my sister-in-law whipped up a simpler version of these tasty tuna bites as a snack. I decided to add capers, shallot, and lemon to make these elegant enough to serve at your next dinner party! I highly recommend using Mary's Gone Crackers\u00ae brand seed crackers; they not only provide the perfect nutty flavor, but they are also very crispy and sturdy, allowing these to be made an hour or two ahead of time.",
