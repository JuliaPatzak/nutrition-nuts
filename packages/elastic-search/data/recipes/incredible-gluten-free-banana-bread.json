    "summary": "This is a heavier, more filling banana bread than others. Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you - it comes together quickly! The almond flour, oat flour, and chia or hemp seeds may be found in your grocery store's organic or gluten-free section, at Trader Joe's\u00ae, or online. My family isn't gluten free (my sister is!), but we all prefer this recipe to any others.",
