    "summary": "A light yet flavorful quinoa dish that goes great with fish or chicken! I invented it on-the-fly one day when I couldn't find quite what I was looking for. For a stronger flavor, add extra lemon juice and herbs. For a more al dente quinoa, remove the lid half way through the cooking time and continue to cook uncovered until most of the water is absorbed.",
