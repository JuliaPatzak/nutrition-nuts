    "summary": "This slow-cooker recipe comes directly from the heart of a wonderful Texas cook who makes the best brisket in the world! Yay, Papa Louis! He shared it with me years ago, via my sister (his daughter-in-law). I change it from time to time by adding ingredients to make it more Mexican (serve it with tortillas), or leave it as is and serve it with fresh rolls.",
