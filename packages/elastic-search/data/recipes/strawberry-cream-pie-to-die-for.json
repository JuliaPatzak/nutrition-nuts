    "summary": "I have been baking this pie since my daughters were very small. They are now 40 and 42. So as you can see, I have been making this pie for a long time. It is always the one they request when we have BBQs in the summertime. I even make it for them in the winter when and if I can find fresh strawberries. I think you will like it also. My grand-daughter said I should name it 'To Die For Strawberry Cream Pie.'",
