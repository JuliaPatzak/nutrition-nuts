    "summary": "This recipe is easily multiplied for a crowd. Everyone in my family asks me to bring this to our functions. I even make it for weddings.  Sometimes I use a mixture of different kinds of pasta, especially if I only have a little of this kind or that.  Depending on what type of macaroni used, more dressing may be required.  The recipe calls for red onion, but sweet onion is great, too.",
