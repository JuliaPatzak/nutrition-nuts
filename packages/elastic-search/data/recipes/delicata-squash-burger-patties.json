    "summary": "Hey vegetarians! I came up with a scrumptious way to eat burgers. And this weird striped little squash. I'm not a vegetarian anymore, but I still make it often because it's so good! Serve in burgers, or by itself with a side of green salad, rice or potatoes. This also makes for a wonderful ravioli stuffing.",
