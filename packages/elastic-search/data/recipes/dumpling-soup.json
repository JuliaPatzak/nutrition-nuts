        "1 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
        "1  egg",
        "\u00be cup water, or as needed",
        "6 medium potatoes - peeled and cubed",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "8 cups water",
        "2 tablespoons butter or margarine",
        "4 ounces sliced bacon, diced",
        "1 large onion, chopped"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt",
        "Crack the egg into a measuring cup, and add enough water to equal 1 cup",
        "Whisk with a fork",
        "Gradually stir the egg-water and oil into the flour mixture with the fork until a soft dough is formed",
        "Use your hands to mix the dough until is smooth and no longer sticky, adding more flour or water as needed",
        "Cover the bowl, and set aside until the potatoes are ready",
        "Place potatoes in a large pot with the salt and water, and bring to a boil",
        "Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender",
        "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat",
        "Add the bacon and onion; cook and stir until onions are golden and bacon is cooked",
        "Set aside",
        "When the potatoes are cooked, pinch off small pieces of the dough, and drop them into the boiling potato water",
        "Turning the dough in your hand will help keep it from sticking to your fingers",

        "Ladle some of the water from the soup into the skillet, and swish it around to clean out all of the tasty bits and juices",
        "Pour back into the soup",
        "Turn off the soup, and let stand for a few minutes before serving"
