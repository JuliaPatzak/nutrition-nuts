    "summary": "Different kind of cracker. Rye flour takes longer to cook then bleached all purpose and it has a little after taste. It mixes well with Cheddar cheese. For people that have not experienced the flavor of rye, it is a nice surprise when they taste the cracker for the first time. Most of the reactions say they taste the Cheddar cheese aftertaste, not realizing it is the rye they are enjoying.",
