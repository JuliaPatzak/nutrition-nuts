    "summary": "I invented this simple pasta salad about ten years ago, and my son requests it as his birthday meal ever since. It's always a hit at potluck dinners and tailgate parties. The trick to make it taste fresh is to dress shortly before serving. The extra dressing in the bottle can be used the next day if there are leftovers to freshen the taste. My son likes the leftovers, but I think it tastes best the day it is made.",
