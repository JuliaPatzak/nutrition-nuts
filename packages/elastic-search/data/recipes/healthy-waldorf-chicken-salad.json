    "summary": "Chicken salad is one of the most versatile sandwich fillings. You can go bold by adding in hot sauce and celery with carrots, you can go sweet with grapes and oranges, or even go exotic with curry. The one factor is generally mayonnaise, and while creamy and delicious, it packs excess fat and calories. My Waldorf chicken salad lightens up with Greek yogurt. Savory Spice Shop\u00ae Park Hill maple pepper is a match made in heaven with this recipe.",
