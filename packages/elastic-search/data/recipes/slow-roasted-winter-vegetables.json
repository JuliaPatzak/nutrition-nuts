    "summary": "This is a mixture my husband came up with using what we had on hand in the fall, and it became a favorite. The first effort for these slow-roasted vegetables was on the BBQ, but it works just as well in the oven. Tastes even better re-heated, and makes great addition to soups and pot pies.",
