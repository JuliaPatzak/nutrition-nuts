    "summary": "The air fryer does a great job on fish, and the topping on these cod fillets is tasty and crunchy. Use the fillets as a main dish with some rice and veggies, or as a sandwich filling, with lettuce, tomato, and remoulade, or your favorite sandwich spread. Make sure the rest of your dinner is nearly done, because these filets will be ready in less than 25 minutes.",
