    "summary": "This sweet potato cake smells like autumn thanks to cinnamon and cloves, and just happens to be vegan. There aren't any hard-to-find ingredients here, just sweet potato, sugar, flour, oil, and spices. The secret to the depth of flavor might be the coffee, but the end result does not taste like a coffee-flavored cake.",
