        "Cut a zip-top bag into 2 rounds the same size as your tortilla press",
        "Place 1 round on the bottom of the press",

        "Turn over and cook second side for 1 minute",
        "Flip and press once or twice with a spatula until tortilla puffs up slightly",
        "Cook for 30 seconds more",
        "Flip one last time and cook for 5 to 10 seconds",
        "Quickly transfer tortilla to the pie dish and fold the towel over to wrap it up",
        "Repeat pressing and cooking the rest of the tortilla dough, stacking and wrapping as you go",
        "Leave the stack of tortillas wrapped until soft and supple, at least 15 minutes"
