    "summary": "Pull out your panini maker and create a yummy sandwich with leftover rotisserie chicken. The cheese forms the first layer, so it can anchor the chicken pieces and get nice and gooey! The recipe is for one sandwich, but it is easily increased, if you have more in your household. Every bakery has a different size for submarine buns, so adjust the ingredients as you need.",
