    "summary": "A quick and easy vegetarian dish for two, or a starter for 4, or even a side. A rustic Italian favorite, taught me by my Roman friends. If serving as a main, then crusty bread, torn off the loaf by hand, and a green salad with a lemon and/or lime vinaigrettey dressing cannot be bettered.",
