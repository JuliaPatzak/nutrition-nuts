    "summary": "I made this because of my husband. He wanted kale in a salad. The rest of the veggies I just happen to have on hand. It became an instant favorite to my husband. Hope you enjoy it as he does!!! You could also use distilled vinegar instead of balsamic. Tweak it to your liking and have fun with it.",
