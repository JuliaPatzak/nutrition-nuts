    "summary": "This quick recipe is a great way to use up old bread. Serve with wine and a nice side salad for a bistro-style meal. For a vegetarian option, substitute slices of Granny Smith apples and old Cheddar cheese for the smoked salmon and cream cheese. You can substitute Italian seasoning for the herbes de Provence, if desired. You can use any artisinal-style bread in place of the French bread.",
