    "summary": "Bright, colorful vegetable zoodle (zucchini spirals) tomato sauce dish that is simple and packed with flavor and shrimp... (of course). You most likely keep these ingredients in your pantry and kitchen all the time. I like hot and spicy foods, so I add that dash of Frank's RedHot\u00ae sauce to give the dish a little kick... yes, it's a Texas \"thang\".",
