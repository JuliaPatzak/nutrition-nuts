    "summary": "This is an excellent, fresh-tasting dip. It is a sort of dry salsa that uses cotija Mexican cheese. The cheese is a crumbly, salty cheese that is very good. You could make this and eat it with corn tortilla chips or add as a garnish to any Mexican-style meal. Without the seeds it is very mild for even a young guest, but can be hotter if you leave in the seeds. Our guests always love it.",
