    "summary": "We were supposed to go a local pub that serves their homemade house chips loaded with the works - melted cheese, sour cream, bacon, etc. Everything you should only have once in a great while. As things worked out we weren't able to go out. Since I was still craving that sinful appetizer and my homemade chips aren't always scrumptious, it dawned on me why not use store-bought kettle-cooked chips and top them! This was the perfect way to indulge in my loaded chip craving.",
