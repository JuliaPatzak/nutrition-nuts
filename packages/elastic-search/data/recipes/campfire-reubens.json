    "summary": "Started by my mom when I was very young, this sandwich has been a tradition for years on family camping trips. My children and grandchild now insist I make them on all our camping trips. Each person assembles their own sandwich just how they like it, with or without sauerkraut, extra cheese, or any way in-between. Use a permanent marker to label the packets. You'll never want another Reuben that isn't made over a campfire!",
