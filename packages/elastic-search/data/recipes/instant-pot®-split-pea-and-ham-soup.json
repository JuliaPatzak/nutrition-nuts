    "summary": "Cooking split peas under pressure makes them nearly instantly creamy. This recipe is very close to a classic split pea soup, but I have the option of cooking with or without a meaty ham bone. If you just have ham, it will be just as great with the combination of celery, carrots, onions, potatoes, and split peas. Get ready for a thick and flavorful broth!",
