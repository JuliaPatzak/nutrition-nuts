    "summary": "Peeling and chopping butternut squash can be quite a chore, but not using this method! By precooking the squash in your Instant Pot\u00ae, the skin will slip right off, allowing you to make this quick and flavorful soup in just minutes! The pears add just the perfect amount of sweetness with no need to add in extra sugar. Garnish with a light drizzle of cream to serve.",
