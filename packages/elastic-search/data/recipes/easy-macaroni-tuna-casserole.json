    "summary": "This dish is super easy. It is also a very hearty delicious bowl of comfort food. The guys in my house loved it. I loved this recipe but I used cream of mushroom soup and added the cheese into the casserole. I also melted butter and added bread crumbs to the top before baking, then sprinkle top lightly with dill seasoning. The resulting casserole was very creamy and flavorful.",
