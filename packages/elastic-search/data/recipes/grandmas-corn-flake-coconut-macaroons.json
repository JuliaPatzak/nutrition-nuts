    "summary": "A fast and easy recipe that is great for mailing to friends and family, festively snowy white, and very tasty with a pleasantly crunchy and chewy texture. This recipe originally comes from my great-grandmother and has been handed down through four generations. My Grandma Sally makes these almost every year for Christmas and it is one of my favorite Christmas cookie recipes. The cookies will be chewy-crunchy when finished cooling, not gooey.",
