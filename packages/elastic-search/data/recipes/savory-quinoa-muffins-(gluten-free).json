    "summary": "These savory, gluten-free muffins are easy to make, and a great breakfast to eat on-the-go. I use as much organic and/or local ingredients as possible in all my recipes. I cook these ahead of time, wrap them separately in waxed paper, then freeze them to heat later for quick, high-protein breakfasts.",
