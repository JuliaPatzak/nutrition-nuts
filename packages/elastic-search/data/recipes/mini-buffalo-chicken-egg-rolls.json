    "summary": "Long ago, in my more oblivious days, I ordered 'boneless Buffalo wings,' only to be disappointed they weren't wings. It's a bit ironic that all these years later, I'm using chicken breast to create a Buffalo wing alternative, but at least I'm not trying to trick anybody. Less messy than bone-in Buffalo wings and more eventful than the 'boneless' kind, these Buffalo chicken egg rolls are a party snack breakthrough. Serve alongside more hot sauce and celery.",
