    "summary": "Created for my preschoolers to do as an individual cooking activity, they are also perfect for single servings. I tried to simply change the portion sizes on other recipes, but they got too complicated. This is just a basic recipe for you to get you started. It would also work as a pre-dinner party activity--lay out a make-your-own-crisp table and have guests create their own concoctions. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.",
