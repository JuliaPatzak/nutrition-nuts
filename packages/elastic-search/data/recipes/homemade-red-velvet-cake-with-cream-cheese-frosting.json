    "summary": "I came up with this recipe after going through tons of recipes and reviews. I like nice solid cakes, and this one is a little on the dense side but it's moist and has good amounts of chocolate and vanilla so that you can taste them but they're not overpowering. It is to-die-for good with frosting that is not too sweet or heavy.",
