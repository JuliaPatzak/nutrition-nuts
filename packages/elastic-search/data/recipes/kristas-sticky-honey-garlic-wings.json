    "summary": "These sweet and sticky chicken wings are sure to be a hit with the whole family. The sauce is so much better than store bought jarred sauce. You can fry the chicken wings, but I prefer baking for less fat. This recipe is equally good with thighs, breasts, or skinless boneless chicken. You'd just have to adjust the cooking time. Serve with fried rice and stir fried veggies. Enjoy!",
