    "summary": "I have looked all over for a great macaroni salad; this one is it! It's easy and is a huge hit at every function I take it to. The sauce for this is a great creamy sauce. I like my salads to have a lot of creamy dressing, so I always make an extra half batch of the wet mix and add it as necessary to get the salad more wet because the pasta soaks up the sauce.",
