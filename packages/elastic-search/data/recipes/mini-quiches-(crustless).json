    "summary": "A great easy cook ahead dish. I like to make these for my boys to eat for breakfast on the go. Good reheated in the microwave. They freeze wonderfully. I often make these with bratwurst sausage and a teaspoon of leftover Knorr\u00ae vegetable-spinach dip. Add mushrooms or olives if you like. You can get creative with ingredients.",
