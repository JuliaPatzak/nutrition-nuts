    "summary": "This soup began as something else that evolved as it was being cooked. After tasting it a few times, it needed something else. So the Thai red curry paste, lime juice, and coconut milk were added after cooking for 4 hours. That was the magic! Everyone who tried it was very satisfied, except one who didn't care for anything spicy. This isn't overpoweringly spicy, just enough heat tamed by the lime juice and coconut milk. Have fun!",
