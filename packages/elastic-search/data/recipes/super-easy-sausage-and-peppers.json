    "summary": "A simple and delicious way to serve sausage and peppers with a tomato-based sauce. This is one of my husband's and kids' favorite meals. They like it served over rice because it makes a lot of 'gravy' that soaks into the rice. It 's one of my favorites because it's quick, easy, and has only a few ingredients that I usually have on hand.",
