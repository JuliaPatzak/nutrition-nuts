    "summary": "These are delicious mushrooms my boyfriend's father made that I tweaked into my own. You can play with different cheeses and sauces including salad dressings. I have found these to be my favorites. I have taken the stems, put them in a food processor and then combined them with some butter and flour to make a steak sauce that is delicious! Nothing goes to waste!",
