    "summary": "This dessert is best served warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. It is also delicious cooled to room temperature. Plan on making it when it will be eaten within 36 hours. The soft cake part can become stale afterward. I tend to make this for company or for a dish to pass event. Preparation time does not include time for pitting cherries.",
