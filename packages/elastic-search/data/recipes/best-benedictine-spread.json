    "summary": "This Louisville staple is an easy and refreshing cucumber spread or dip and can be served with almost anything you could imagine. Dipping club crackers or pita and French bread toast points are favorites, but carrot sticks and pretzels are great too. We use it for cucumber sandwiches, spread it onto our BLTs, and use it as a sauce on poached salmon. You can serve it immediately or refrigerate it to firm up and let the flavors meld.",
