    "summary": "I love shrimp toast from the Chinese restaurants. Some restaurants make them really well and some do not. I love to cook and wanted to give it a try. I set out my search for a good tasting recipe. After trying several, I came up with my own! My recipe will knock your socks off! I have to stop myself from eating them before I finish my batch.",
