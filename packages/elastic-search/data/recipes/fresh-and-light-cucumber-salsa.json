    "summary": "This is such a fresh and light salsa. I made this one day when I needed some extra ingredients and decided to throw some cucumbers in. I now make this for every picnic or party I go to. It is requested. Wherever I am, I have to give the recipe to someone. I keep this in my fridge at all times and all my kids love it. A great way to get them to eat their veggies.",
