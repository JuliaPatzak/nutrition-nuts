    "summary": "This intense, flavor-packed, Vietnamese classic was actually introduced to me at a popular night spot in New York's Chinatown. Salt-and-pepper shrimp are meant to be eaten whole, body, shell, head, everything. More often than not, they are deep-fried, but after trying it both ways, we actually prefer pan frying them in less oil.",
