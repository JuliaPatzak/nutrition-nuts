    "summary": "I developed this recipe for those days when you want homemade bread but you don't want to turn on the oven and heat the house. It's simple to make with ingredients that you probably have on hand. I get this started in the evening to enjoy for lunch. The longer the dough is allowed to ferment, the more complex the flavor of the loaf.",
