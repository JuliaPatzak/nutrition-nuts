    "summary": "I recently came back from Del Mar, CA, and a few of the Mexican restaurants served Sonoran-style Caldo De Pollo. I attempted to mimic this recipe as closely as I could to match the delicious soup I ate there. I'm open to suggestions to make this recipe better as this is my first time attempting it.",
