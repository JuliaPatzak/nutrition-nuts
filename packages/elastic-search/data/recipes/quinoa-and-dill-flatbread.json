    "summary": "A great way to use quinoa! It can be used as a crust or flatbread, made into a main dish, side dish, or appetizer! This is one that works well and can be easily changed with the herbs you have on hand or in your garden. We are starting clean-eating this week and tweaked some recipes. This can also be used as a pizza crust, topped with hummus, bruschetta, pesto, or even egg/tofu salad. It's great for any gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, or vegetarian diet.",
