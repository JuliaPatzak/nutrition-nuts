        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Spray a baking pan with cooking spray, place chicken breasts in the pan, and cover with a lid or foil",
        "Bake in the oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)",
        "Remove from the oven and shred with 2 forks",
        "While the chicken is roasting, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil",
        "Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes",
        "Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat",
