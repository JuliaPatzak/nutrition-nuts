    "summary": "This is a true chile con queso that can be eaten with tostadas or in a warm corn tortilla. This is not like the Americanized version of chili con queso that we have become used to that is a cheese dip, which I also love. This is the way my grandma used to make it. The great thing about this recipe is you can play with it and adjust it to your personal taste. If you like it cheesier add more cheese. You can't mess this up unless you burn it.",
