    "summary": "Frozen salmon fillets are so economical, but I often forget to defrost them! This recipe calls for adding frozen salmon fillets directly to your Instant Pot\u00ae for a perfectly cooked fillet in mere minutes. I finish the salmon under the broiler for just 2 minutes with a honey-mustard glaze on top. Delicious!",
