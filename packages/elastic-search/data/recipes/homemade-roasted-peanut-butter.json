    "summary": "This recipe makes a wonderful peanut butter that's better than anything in the store. It's all natural, and doesn't separate like some of the so-called natural peanut butters you can buy. I like chunky peanut butter, so I mix the batch until it is very smooth, then mix in peanuts that have been chopped separately.",
