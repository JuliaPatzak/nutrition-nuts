    "summary": "A lovely and fresh pasta salad my dad threw together one night that became a favorite. It's also very flexible. As Dad says, 'If you want to put something else in, go ahead, ain't no big deal. As long as no one starts poking it with a fork and mumbling,'had a failed science experiment look like this once, only it smelled better,' you're doin' just fine.'",
