    "summary": "Devilishly good and (almost) paleo-approved! Use the leftover drippings to fry some side-dish veggies, or just drizzle on top of the completed chicken. Go ahead and modify the cheese; any stinky cheese will do. Can also substitute candied walnuts or pecans for standard walnuts for a unique sweet-and-savory flavor.",
