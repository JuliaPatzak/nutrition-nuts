    "summary": "I grew up in Nova Scotia where seafood was cheap.  My Mom and grandmothers had some pretty inventive ways of making lobster 'not-boring!'  Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune.  I've paid over ten dollars for one of these lobster rolls in Cape Cod and it wasn't half as good or half as big as the ones my Mom taught me to make.  This is a wonderful summer (or winter) treat and makes a fancy luncheon to impress your friends.  (And no, I don't eat the green stuff in the lobster!)",
