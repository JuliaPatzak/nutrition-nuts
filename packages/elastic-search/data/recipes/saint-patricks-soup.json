    "summary": "This soup is the perfect way to transform the last of that corned beef into something different, yet still the same. I purposely set some aside just to make this soup. Feel free to sub beef broth for the vegetable broth but just know it will alter the color of the finished soup tremendously making it not as appealing to the eyes.",
