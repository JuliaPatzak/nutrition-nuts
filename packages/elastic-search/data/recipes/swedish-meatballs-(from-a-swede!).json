    "summary": "This is my mom's Swedish meatball recipe. This isn't the kind a lot of people are used to in a creamy white sauce. She served them every Christmas Eve in a chafing dish as part of the 'Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord.' My mom used to have a vegetable sour cream and a lingonberry sauce on the table for those that might want to dip these in something.",
