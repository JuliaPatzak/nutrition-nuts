    "summary": "I love a one-dish baking recipe, to cut down on mess and clean-up! Unlike some gluten-free or grain-free baked goods, these have a pleasant texture as well. Experiment by adding your choice of nuts, flavored chocolate chips, and different flavor extracts. Top with icing if you wish. At Christmas, crushed candy canes and 1 1/2 teaspoons mint extract make for a nice holiday treat.",
