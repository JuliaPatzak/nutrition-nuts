    "summary": "These fluffy and extra-thick Japanese pancakes are mouthwatering! They are soft and spongy, and a true indulgence. The super secret ingredient is the mayonnaise. It's just emulsified oil and vinegar, and I promise it will make your pancakes thicker and fluffier; it gives it just the right \"lift\". I use Kewpie\u00ae mayo, but you can try with any regular mayo. Please let me know what you think!",
