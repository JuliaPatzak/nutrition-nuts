    "summary": "A fruit salad has to be pretty darn good to actually get a name, and the venerable Waldorf salad is certainly worthy.\u00a0Embellish this as you see fit, but I really like it best with just the four ingredients seen here. Things like dried cranberries can add a nice seasonal touch but, for me, the chewy fruit gets in the way of that addictive crunchy/crisp texture.",
