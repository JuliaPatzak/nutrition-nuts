        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Unfold both sheets of puff pastry and lay onto a lightly floured work surface",
        "Cut each sheet into 3 strips along the fold marks, then cut each strip into 4 squares to make 12 pastry squares per sheet",

        "Bake in the preheated oven until the puff pastry is golden brown, about 15 minutes",
