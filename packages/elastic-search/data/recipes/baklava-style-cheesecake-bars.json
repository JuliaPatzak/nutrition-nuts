    "summary": "When I think of baklava, I think of flaky, crispy pastry and sticky honey-lemon syrup with crunchy nuts. These cheesecake bars hit all those notes and more! The added tang of the cream cheese layer only works to enhance the bright tang from the lemon in the honey syrup. Keep these refrigerated for up to 3 days.",
