    "summary": "Probably like you, I'm always trying to create new recipe ideas using leftover rotisserie chicken. This one brings leftover lemon pepper rotisserie chicken, that you would buy from your local grocery store, to a whole new level. This slightly sweet and crunchy salad can be served on a bed of romaine lettuce with sliced ripe avocado or on toasted mini sandwich slices (your choice of flavor) as a unique luncheon main course or appetizer for special guests.",
