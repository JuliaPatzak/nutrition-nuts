    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup heavy whipping cream",
        "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips",
        "baking spray with flour",
        "1 (16.5 ounce) package refrigerated cookie dough (such as Pillsbury\u00ae)",
        "3 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella\u00ae)",
        "1 (10 ounce) package miniature marshmallows",
        "colorful sprinkles",
        "1 cup mini pretzels"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Pour heavy cream into a microwave-safe measuring cup",
        "Heat in the microwave in 10-second intervals until warm to the touch, but not hot enough to scald you",
        "Place chocolate chips in a medium mixing bowl",
        "Pour warm cream over the chocolate",
        "Do not stir",
        "Cover and let stand until chocolate chips are completely melted, about 30 minutes",
        "Remove the lid and whisk ganache until smooth",
        "If some of the chocolate chips haven't melted all the way, reheat in the microwave at 5-second intervals",
        "Let ganache cool while you make the cookie cups",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Spray a mini muffin tin thoroughly with baking spray, getting every nook and cranny",
        "Place one chilled cookie dough piece in the center of each muffin cup",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes",
        "Carefully turn the cookie cups out onto a cooling rack",
        "Let cool for 1 minute",
        "Gently flip the cookie cups so they are right side up",
        "The cookie cups will be delicate and easily broken, so be gentle on this step",
        "If the center of the cookies didn't sink during baking, press hot cookies very gently with a mini cookie scoop, melon baller, or your thumb to form indentations",
        "Allow to cool completely",
        "Using an icing spreader, scoop out a small amount of the ganache and spread it gently into the center of the cookie cups",
        "Top with chocolate-hazelnut spread",
        "Press a few mini marshmallows into the chocolate; scatter sprinkles over the top",
        "Break off the pretzels so that the curved part resembles a 'handle'",
        "Dip each end into ganache and press against the side of the cookie cups",
        "Let stand until ganache firms up and keeps the handles in place"
