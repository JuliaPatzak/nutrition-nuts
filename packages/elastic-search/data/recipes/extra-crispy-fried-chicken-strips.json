    "directions": [
        "Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl",
        "Mix eggs and water together in a small bowl",

        "Return to the flour mixture and coat again; repeat with egg mixture",
        "Coat once more in the flour mixture, placing strips on a plate while you continue with remaining chicken",
        "Let strips sit for 5 minutes to allow flour to set",
