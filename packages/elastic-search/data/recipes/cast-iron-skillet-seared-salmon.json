    "summary": "I am a big fan of salmon skin, especially if it's salted and a bit crispy and chewy. This recipe gives me that. Plus, the way it's cooked, the fish has a 'steamed' quality to it. Do not uncover the fillets or move them around as they cook. I always use my cast-iron skillet for this because it always comes out best!",
