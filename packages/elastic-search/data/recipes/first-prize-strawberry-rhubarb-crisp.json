    "summary": "I came across this recipe in a magazine, and with a few adjustments I was able to make it into a delicious crisp. It goes great with vanilla ice cream and one can also alter the recipe to make a mango raspberry crisp which is just as delightful! Optional: sprinkle the top with a handful of rolled oats and brown sugar.",
