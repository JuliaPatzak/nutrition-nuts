    "summary": "A definite crowd pleaser, and not too spicy for those who usually shy away from chili or salsa dips.  Served with tortilla chips.  Best served warm, but still retains a good dipping consistency when cold or at room temperature. This dip can be served in a \"bread bowl\" (a hollowed out round loaf).",
