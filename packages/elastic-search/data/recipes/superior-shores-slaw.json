    "summary": "This is a different type of coleslaw made with lots of bacon! My husband and I went up to the northern shore of Lake Superior to get away for a few days. He was grilling. I was making some side dishes. We really wanted a salad, so I made this with the ingredients we had. We both loved it! Sometimes I use white vinegar, but my husband prefers the red wine vinegar.",
