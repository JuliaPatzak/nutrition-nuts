    "summary": "This was just a creation I came up with when my asparagus was looking a little old. At first, I thought I was going to add some sort of cream base, but the soup ended up not needing it. The vegetables just taste lovely as they are. Even my husband who hates soup and asparagus LOVED this!  It is also a great way to use almost-expired vegetables in your veggie drawer!",
