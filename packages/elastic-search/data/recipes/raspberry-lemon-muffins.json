    "summary": "This is the perfect muffin - really yummy flavor yet not much sugar. I've used different fruits too - blueberries and raspberries are our absolute favorites, but strawberries, peaches, or cherries are good too - frozen or fresh. You can use any kind of yogurt without fruit on the bottom. Easily adaptable to what you have. Hope you enjoy!",
