    "summary": "Inspired by the Julie and Julia motion picture, here is a little twist on one of the most the delicious-looking recipes to grace the movie screen! Unless you and your guests are prepared to eat the bruschetta immediately, I suggest keeping the heirloom tomato mixture separate from the bread because it will become soggy. Serve the tomato mixture in one bowl and the bread on another serving platter. Be prepared to get a little messy!",
