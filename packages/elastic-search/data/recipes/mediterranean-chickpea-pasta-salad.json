    "summary": "It can be hard to find picnic-friendly recipes that are vegan and gluten free. I made this salad using chickpea pasta for friends who can't eat gluten or dairy. I used produce I had just harvested from my garden, but you can change up the vegetables based on what you have on hand! If you're not avoiding dairy, feta cheese would be a great addition.",
