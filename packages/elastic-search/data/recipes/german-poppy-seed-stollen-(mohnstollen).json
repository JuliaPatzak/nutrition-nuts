    "summary": "This wonderful poppy seed stollen recipe is straight from Germany. It tastes best if you can freshly grind your poppy seeds. In Germany there are special poppy seed grinders, but you can use a mortar and pestle. Don't use a regular spice grinder, as poppy seeds contain a lot of oil and your grinder will get clogged up.",
