        "\u00bc cup coarsely crushed black peppercorns",
        "4 (6 ounce) 1 1/2 inch thick filet mignon steaks",

        "Melt the butter with the olive oil over high heat in a heavy skillet (not nonstick) until the foam disappears from the butter",
        "Gently place the steaks in the pan, and cook until they start to become firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 3 1/2 minutes per side",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C)",
        "Remove the steaks to platter, and cover tightly with foil",
        "Pour the beef broth into the skillet, and use a whisk to stir the broth and scrape up any dissolved brown flavor bits from the skillet",

        "Place the steaks back in the skillet, turn to coat with sauce, and serve with the remaining sauce"
