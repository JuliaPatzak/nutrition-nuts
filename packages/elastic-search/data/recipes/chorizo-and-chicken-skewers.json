    "summary": "At some point this summer, you'll get tired of grilled chicken. No matter the marinade or the delivery system, you will simply reach your limit, and that's when you need to reach for the chorizo. Impale a few slices of this famously delicious Spanish sausage in between your chunks of chicken. As it grills it will splatter its spicy, smokey fat all over its much blander skewer-mate, and once again you and grilled chicken will be good buddies.",
