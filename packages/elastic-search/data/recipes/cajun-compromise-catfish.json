    "summary": "A fast, tasty, spicy fried fish recipe which can be adjusted to suit the cook's (or diner's) preference. I call it Cajun Compromise because the spice level is the result of a compromise between my wife and I. It can be served with tartar sauce for the timid, or hot sauce for the not-so-timid. Great for appetizers or a main dish.",

        "\u00bc cup all-purpose flour",
        "\u00bc cup cornmeal",
        "2 teaspoons ground black pepper",
        "2 teaspoons ground mustard",

    "directions": [
        "Soak the fish pieces in milk for at least 30 minutes",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and hot pepper sauce",
        "In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, pepper, mustard and Cajun seasoning",
        "Dip fish pieces into the dry mixture, then into the egg, then back into the dry mix",
        "Set on a plate in the refrigerator and chill for about 15 minutes",
        "This will help the batter stick to the fish",

        "Fry fish pieces for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown",
