    "summary": "This recipe occurred semi-accidentally. I was studying various Thai recipes and examining the flavors, and went home to stare at my fridge, and out came this recipe. A wonderful condiment to eat with this dish, and many other asian dishes, is Sambal Oelek, a garlic-chili paste you can find in the asian section of most groceries and asian specialty stores. It's quite spicy, and quite tasty.",
