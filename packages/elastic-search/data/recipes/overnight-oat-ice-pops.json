    "summary": "This is always a good summer treat for the kids, and adults will love it to. I first thought of this when I was setting up a BBQ party we had one summer. Me and a few friends all had kids the same age and were all pretty young back then, so we hadn't experimented with kid-friendly foods all that much. We wanted a refreshing treat on the healthier side, and this recipe was born.",
