    "summary": "A delicious take on everyone's two favorite appetizers - Buffalo wings and fried calamari! Fresh, homemade calamari drizzled with blue cheese and hot sauce, topped with a cooling tomato relish. Hard to give a serving size, as my daughter Evan and I finish a whole recipe between us, or I'll make a plate for myself (only) as an entree! The beauty is, you can adjust just about all of the ingredients to taste!",
