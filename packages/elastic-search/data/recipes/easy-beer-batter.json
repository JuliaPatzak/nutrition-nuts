    "summary": "First rule of beer batter: Beer batter is not complicated, it should only contain beer and self-raising flour. Second rule of beer batter: The beer should be cold. Third rule of beer batter: You DO NOT need to sift the flour and don't over-whisk it. A few lumps actually makes for a better texture. Fourth and most important rule of beer batter: It is important to choose the correct beer according to what you are going to cook. As any ingredient ranges in texture and taste, so does beer.",
