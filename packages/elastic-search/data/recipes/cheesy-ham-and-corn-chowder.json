    "summary": "Chowders always bring to mind a picture of a cozy, kicked-back, winter-time family meal; cuddled up around a roaring fireplace with plenty of warm food, good cheer and loving friends. This one is a Sunday night family favorite - easy on the cook (and the cook's pocketbook), yet sure to bring raves from the hubby and kids. Enjoy!",
