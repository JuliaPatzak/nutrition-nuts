    "summary": "This stuff is soooooo good!  You can either make it from scratch as I have it here, or you can simply add the pumpkin and spices to a pre-made 32 fl. oz container of hummus. I have played around with it in different recipes, but it makes such a good dip for either soft pita or chips.  It is savory and warm tasting and I heartily recommend everyone try it! Be sure to use pureed pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.",
