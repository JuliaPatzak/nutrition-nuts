    "summary": "These muffins take only minutes to put together, require little clean up and are easy enough for even inexperienced cooks to make! I have used white, yellow, and French vanilla cake mix with this. They all turn out well, but the white cake mix is my favorite. These muffins are good when first baked, but they are best when served the next day.",
