        "Beat in the egg and the water",
        "Gradually beat in the flour, baking soda and salt",
        "Form cookies on an ungreased baking sheet with a cookie press or roll into balls and smash flat with a floured fork or fingers",
        "Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes or more until done, usually when the puffed up cookie has lowered down to level",
        "Before then it is more chewy",
