    "summary": "A girlfriend's mom made this spread years ago for our Teen Club Luncheon back in Iowa in the 50's. I asked her to tell my Mom  how to make it. I made the recipe for my kids while they were growing up & they still love it. Sweet relish and eggs round out the flavor of bologna in this simple but delicious spread. Serve it on cocktail toast, or use it in sandwiches. The amount of egg, creamy salad dressing and relish should be adjusted to taste.",
