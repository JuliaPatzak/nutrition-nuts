    "summary": "This recipe is so good and surprisingly easy. The chicken comes out of the oven crispy yet stays moist with an indulgent filling. Chicken can be stuffed and wrapped the night before; ideal for entertaining! I like to serve this with pasta or with mashed potatoes and a quick pan gravy. Carbohydrate conscious? This recipe also goes great with a salad of mixed greens and vinaigrette.",
