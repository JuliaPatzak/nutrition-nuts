    "summary": "Freezes beautifully! I always keep a batch or two of this frozen, ready for unexpected company, or just for summertime ease. Guests will never know you made it weeks in advance. So simple, but this salad always gets compliments and requests for the recipe. A healthy and cooling addition to any summer lunch or dinner--pulling this out of the freezer really helps out when you're caught short or it's too hot to be stuck in the kitchen! Can be made and kept fresh in the fridge for several days before serving, or frozen (undrained) for several weeks.",
