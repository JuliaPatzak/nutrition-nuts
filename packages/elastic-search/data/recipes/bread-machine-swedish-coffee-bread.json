    "summary": "This is a delicious Swedish coffee bread recipe converted for use with a bread maker! My family is Swedish, and ever year we make this recipe just in time for Christmas. We always enjoy it especially on Christmas morning. We used to make a long, drawn out version that was my great-grandmother's recipe, but thanks to modern conveniences like the bread maker it takes much less time and work! I hope your family enjoys this as much as mine has.",
