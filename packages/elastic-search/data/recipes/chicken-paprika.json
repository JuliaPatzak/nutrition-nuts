    "summary": "My whole family, full of picky eaters, loves this dish, and it's great for freezing and reheating on a cold day or for an easy dinner on cold nights. This dish comes out as more like a stew than a meat with a sauce. Serve over egg noodles or hot cooked rice. Goes great with fresh, crusty pumpernickel bread for hearty winter meal. Easy to make and can be kept on low heat on the stove for lengthy parties.",
