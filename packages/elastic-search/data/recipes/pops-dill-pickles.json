    "summary": "Pop has been making these crunchy, best tasting pickles for years. I have been making for about 4 years, and recently started adding fresh garlic cloves to my canning jars. I know there are a lot of good pickle recipes out there, but this is one of the best tasting pickles ever. Some people eat their pickles about a week after, but I say wait, because the longer you wait the better they are.",
