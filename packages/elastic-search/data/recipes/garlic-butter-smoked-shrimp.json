    "summary": "One of the quickest meals you can make in your smoker is shrimp, done in just 30 minutes. These shrimp are lightly seasoned to let the smoke flavor shine, but add more seasoning if desired. Because of the short smoke time, feel free to use a stronger-flavored wood such as hickory or mesquite. Serve with cheesy grits, rice, atop a salad, or as an appetizer with a remoulade sauce.",
