    "summary": "Nothing is more stunning at the dinner table than serving a whole fried fish with a fragrant unctuous sauce. Buy a lean, mild, and flaky fish that is 10 to 14 ounces, such as tilapia, fresh water trout, or anything from the snapper family. Caution should be used when deep-frying the fish, so make sure you have plenty of room and a big pot. Serve with steamed jasmine rice.",
