    "summary": "This type of rustic dessert is called a buckle because the fruit sinks into the buttery batter as it bakes and 'buckles' the surface with its juicy weight. I was going to tell you to use any berry you want, but I changed my mind. This really needs to be done with blackberries. I added a handful of almond meal, since I had it around, and I think almonds and blackberries have a thing for one another.",
