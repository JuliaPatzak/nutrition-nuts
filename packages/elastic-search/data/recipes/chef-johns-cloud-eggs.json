    "summary": "You've probably seen these things blowing up on social media recently, and by recently, I mean like 2 years ago. These are very easy to do, very fun to make, super cool to look at, and very enjoyable to eat. This could also be a pretty cool menu item for a Mother's Day brunch. Serve on generously buttered toast with a pinch of cayenne and a sprinkle of coarse sea salt.",

        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as Silpat\u00ae) and butter lightly",

        "Pour vinegar into the egg whites, add salt, and whip with a whisk until we have relatively firm, but not dry, peaks",
        "Spoon onto the prepared baking sheet, making sure they are not too wide, as we want some height here",

        "Bake in center of the preheated oven until they just start to take on some golden color, 5 to 6 minutes",
