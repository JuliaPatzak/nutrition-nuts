    "summary": "My mother is from Chile and these have been a staple of our household for years. I have searched and searched and never seem to find the right one, so here is our family favorite. My mom likes to sprinkle sugar on hers. I prefer a little mustard to dip it in. We all have our own cravings. This recipe makes about a dozen large empanadas, depending on the size.",
