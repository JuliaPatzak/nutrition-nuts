    "summary": "Recipe I've had for over 25 years. In Puerto Rico, the brazo gitano made by Franco in Mayaguez is a favorite. This homemade version may not be an exact duplicate but it is just as good or better, in my opinion. Mix and match the fillings to your taste. Cream cheese along with the fruit of your choice is a favorite of many.",
