    "summary": "This beautiful salad is delicious and nutritious, too! Grilled salmon is combined with fresh spinach, red bell pepper, fresh mushrooms, and fresh strawberries. Garnished with chopped pecans and a bit of crumbled bacon--leave out the bacon, if you must. I justify it because there is no added sugar in the vinaigrette.",
