    "summary": "This recipe was given to me by my mom, but I've also tweaked it. I can't guarantee that it isn't from a cookbook somewhere--mom can't remember where it came from--but it's an old family favorite and a great soup for a fall day. Made in a pressure cooker, it takes approximately 20 minutes for a full, hearty meal. This soup also freezes beautifully.",
