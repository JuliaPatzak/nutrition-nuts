    "summary": "An Eastern European delicacy. Probably one of the most loved foods from the Balkans. There are two ways to create burek: with homemade dough or with phyllo dough (pre-made store-bought). In this recipe we will be using the pre-made phyllo dough. You can put potatoes, meat, spinach, boiled cabbage, or feta cheese inside! This one will be with feta cheese. Truly a tasty meal! And very easy to make! Eat with yogurt for authenticity.",
