    "summary": "This crowd pleaser and appetizer is a fusion meal combining elements of Indian cooking and Tex-Mex. You get the flavor profile of the tikka chicken with that of the jalapeno popper, which in turn forms a unique taste experience. This recipe yields enough for an appetizer for a backyard BBQ/tailgate gathering or as a main course in itself. In this recipe it calls for the poppers to be baked, but it is perfectly fine to be made on the BBQ pit as well.",
