    "summary": "The milder flavor and smooth texture of whipped cannellini beans well complement the flavor and texture of canned pumpkin puree, creating a versatile base for both a spicy bean dip and, with added liquid, a tasty bean soup (serve hot or chilled). Include fresh herbs such as parsley or cilantro to complete this quick and easy appetizer or aromatic side dish. Serve with plain pita crisps, crackers, or tortilla chips.",
