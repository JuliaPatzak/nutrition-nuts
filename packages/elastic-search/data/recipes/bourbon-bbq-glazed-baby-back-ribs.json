        "Combine all the ingredients for the dry rub in a small bowl and mix together well",
        "Tear a large enough piece of Reynolds Wrap\u00ae Aluminum Foil to place rack of ribs on it and be able to fully cover, meat side up",
        "Evenly coat both sides of the ribs with the dry rub, pressing it in with your hands",
        "Fold up the sides of the foil to create a rim, and pour the apple juice in around the ribs",

        "Preheat oven to 225 degrees F and cook ribs for about 4 hours",

        "Combine all the BBQ sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat",
        "Reduce to a simmer and allow the sauce to thicken and reduce by about a third, stirring occasionally",
