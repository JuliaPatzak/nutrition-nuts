    "summary": "This is a traditional Muslim bean pie that most people have never had and even more have never made.  Made with navy beans, it is surprisingly a wonderful dessert. Once you've had it, you'll love making it.  There are only a few recipes for this pie and it took me years of tweaking other recipes to come up with one that actually makes an edible bean pie. This recipe you can trust to make an awesome dessert.",
