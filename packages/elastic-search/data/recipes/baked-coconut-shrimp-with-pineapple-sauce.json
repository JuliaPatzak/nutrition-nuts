    "summary": "I love the big succulent coconut shrimp found at a popular restaurant. Unfortunately, due to health reasons I can't indulge in that shrimp anymore. I created a recipe that satisfies my craving and tastes just as indulgent, but without the guilt! Can be served as an entree or as an appetizer.",
