    "summary": "I adapted a pumpkin muffin recipe to come up with this delectable sweet potato concoction that is a true muffin, and not a cake! I think the sweet potato lends even more flavor than pumpkin. Added bonus: this recipe just happens to be dairy free, a plus for those who are intolerant to dairy.",
