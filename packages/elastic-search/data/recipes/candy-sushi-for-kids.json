    "summary": "Candy sushi is perfect for kids' birthdays or an April Fool's day joke. It is the most yummy thing I've ever made beside my orange Creamsicle\u00ae pie. And its very simple, so even my 6-year-old can make it! If you want to be more creative, spread frosting and sprinkles on the top of the circle under the Swedish Fish\u00ae!",
