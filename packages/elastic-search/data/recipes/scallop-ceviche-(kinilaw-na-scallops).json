    "summary": "An acidic marinade is all that is needed to cook this spicy and sour scallop ceviche. You can also serve the scallops on toasted sesame crackers. As with all ceviches, the acidic marinade \"cooks\" the seafood without heat-and it happens pretty quickly. So it's good to make this at the last minute and set it out just before people dig in.",
