    "summary": "Yummy, highly seasoned steak nuggets, deep fried and served with Ranch dressing -- just like in the fast food joints in Idaho in the '70's!  I missed these so much that I kept playing with the ingredients until I finally came up with this perfect re-creation of the real thing.  A taste of the old times when we didn't know how bad deep frying was for us! Serve with ranch dressing, or your favorite bbq sauce, steak sauce, or blue cheese dressing!",
