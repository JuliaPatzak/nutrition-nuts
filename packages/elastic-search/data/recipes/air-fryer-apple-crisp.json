    "summary": "Nothing screams fall like warm apple crisp! You can use any variety of apples that you like, but I prefer a mixture of tart (Granny Smith or MacIntosh) and sweet (Honeycrisp or Fuji). Using your air fryer is perfect for a small portion! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired.",
