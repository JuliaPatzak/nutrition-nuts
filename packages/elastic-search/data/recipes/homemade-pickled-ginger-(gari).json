    "summary": "Pickled ginger is called gari or amazu shoga in Japanese. It's served with sushi or sashimi and eaten between different kinds of sushi. It helps to clean your taste buds and enhance the flavors. It's also great with Century Eggs - a Chinese delicacy. You can find prepared pickled ginger in pink or white at most Asian markets but I preferred to make my own and share with family and friends.",

        "8 ounces fresh young ginger root, peeled",
        "1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons sea salt",
        "1 cup rice vinegar",
        "\u2153 cup white sugar"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Cut the ginger into chunks and place them into a bowl",
        "Sprinkle with sea salt, stir to coat and let stand for about 30 minutes",
        "Transfer the ginger to a clean jar",
        "In a saucepan, stir together the rice vinegar and sugar until sugar has dissolved",
        "Bring to a boil, then pour the boiling liquid over the ginger root pieces in the jar",
        "Allow the mixture to cool, then put the lid on the jar and store in the refrigerator for at least one week",
        "You will see that the liquid will change to slightly pinkish in few minutes",
        "Don't be alarmed because it's the reaction of rice vinegar that causes the change",
        "Only quality rice vinegar can do that! Some commercial pickled ginger has red coloring added",
        "Cut pieces of ginger into paper thin slices for serving"
