    "summary": "If you are looking for an alternative to potato chips you have to give zucchini chips a try as a clean and healthy snack. Zucchini chips taste amazing and they are low carb, paleo and gluten free. They are simple to make but they do take time to bake. You could use a food dehydrator too if you have one (I don't).",
