    "summary": "These ladyfingers are soaked with espresso and layered with a light, airy cream filling of mascarpone cheese and Grand Marnier\u00ae brandy. A salted caramel sauce rounds this dessert out, elevating it to not just another run-of-the-mill tiramisu. Tiramisu can be chilled up to 2 days, but no longer or else the ladyfingers will break down and become mushy.",
