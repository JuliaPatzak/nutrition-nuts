    "summary": "This is a favorite recipe in my family. It is modified from an old recipe from Southern Living magazine. I like to serve these mustard thighs with chicken-flavored rice. Even my picky kids love this. You can adjust the heat by adding more hot sauce (I like to do 3 tablespoons often) or less, depending on tastes.",
