    "summary": "It's easy to love fall-off-the-bone short ribs. The only problem with a traditional braising recipe is that it will be hours before eating happens. Make short ribs in an electric pressure cooker and eat these in half the time. The pressure inside the cooker transforms any liquid into hot steam, which goes deep into the meat and produce far more tender ribs than any other method would make. Less time and better? You bet.",
