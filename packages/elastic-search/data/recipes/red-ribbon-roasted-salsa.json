    "summary": "This recipe originated from a recipe that was supposed to duplicate that of my favorite Mexican restaurant. I've heavily modified the original recipe and like this variation SO much more! It's relatively easy. This makes a medium-hot salsa. I've named it 'Red-Ribbon' because it took second place at my company salsa competition last Cinco de Mayo (lost first in a tie-breaker!).",
