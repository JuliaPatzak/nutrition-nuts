    "summary": "Inspired by an incredibly popular salad sold in a local award winning market here in Woodstock, VT.  Since they don't give out the recipe, I had to figure it out on my own.  But I (and others) believe that my version is infinitely better, and I'm sure you will agree.  This light, fresh and healthy salad is perfect for summer days and presents well for BBQ's, potlucks, and dinner parties alike and it is guaranteed to impress and get rave reviews every time.",
