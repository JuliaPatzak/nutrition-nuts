    "summary": "This is my grandmother's oyster stuffing recipe that has been handed down. It is a favorite for Thanksgiving and Christmas and very simple to make. If you cook your turkey at 325 degrees F, it will be perfect if the stuffing is cooked alongside it at that temp as well. It can also be baked in a muffin tin for individual servings.",
