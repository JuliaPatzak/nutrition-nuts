    "summary": "This is a great date night meal! It will make a ton of leftovers, so you can send some home with your boo. I make this with a decent bottle of Sauvignon Blanc because the acidity in the wine pairs well with the lemon juice and the fresh cut grass-like aromas of the asparagus. Chill the rest of the bottle and have it with your meal! Remember to always use a wine that you enjoy the flavor of by itself if you're going to cook with it because the food takes on the flavor of the wine.",
