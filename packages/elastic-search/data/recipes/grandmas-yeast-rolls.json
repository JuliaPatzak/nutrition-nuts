    "summary": "I have adapted these yeast rolls from my grandmother's yeast bread recipe. I have increased the sugar to create a little sweeter roll than Grandma used to make and replaced her refrigerated cake yeast with dried (easier availability). They are delicious served with Danish Lurpak\u00ae butter (it's a little tangy, just like Grandma's)! Rolls can be made the night before and reheated, covered in foil, at 300 degrees F for about ten minutes.",

    "ingredients": [
        "\u00be cup white sugar, divided",
        "1\u2009\u00be cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)",
        "2\u2009\u00bd (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast",
        "6\u2009\u00bd cups unbleached all-purpose flour (such as King Arthur\u00ae), or as needed",
        "2 teaspoons salt",
        "\u00bc cup lard, melted"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Dissolve 1 tablespoon of sugar into the water in a small bowl",
        "Sprinkle the yeast over the water; let stand 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam",
        "Meanwhile, whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, and salt together in a bowl",
        "Once the yeast has foamed, stir the melted lard into the yeast, then stir the yeast mixture into the flour until a sticky dough forms",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes",
        "You may need to add additional flour to keep the dough from sticking",
        "Once elastic, cover the dough with the mixing bowl, and allow to rest for 15 minutes",
        "Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with lard",
        "Cut the dough into three equal sections, then cut each section into 8 pieces",
        "Form into balls and place into the prepared baking dish in 6 rows of 4",
        "Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes",
        "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the rolls are golden brown and the bottoms sound hollow when tapped, about 1 hour",
        "Allow to cool at least 10 minutes before eating"
