    "summary": "Because it's three layers, this sounds hard but it's worth it.  My son is famous for making and taking these in to work.  I've heard other names but here in the Northwest everyone knows them as Nanaimo bars. They are sold on British Columbia Ferries and at coffee stands. If you can't find custard powder, I've used instant pudding mix with good results.",
