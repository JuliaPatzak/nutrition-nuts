    "summary": "After experimenting for a while, we finally came up with a New York-style ricotta cheesecake that works perfectly in a 7-inch cheesecake pan that fits in an Instant Pot\u00ae. This recipe is great for a cheesecake that requires fewer ingredients, and a few people can enjoy it over a couple of days. It always tastes better on the second day. We have served it with cherries, raspberries, and strawberries on top, and whipped cream if we're feeling indulgent.",
