    "directions": [
        "Stir 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the yeast into the warm water in a small bowl",
        "The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C)",
        "Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam",
        "Whisk together the cinnamon and 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl; set aside",
        "Beat together the eggs, applesauce, salt, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar in a large bowl",
        "Stir in the yeast mixture",
        "Beat in half of the flour mixture until no dry spots remain",
        "Stir in the remaining flour, a 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition to form a sticky dough",
        "Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until fairly smooth but still sticky, about 8 minutes",
        "Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil",
        "Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) for 30 minutes",
        "Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan",
        "Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface",
        "Roll the dough into a 16x20 inch rectangle",
        "Spread the honey over the dough; sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar and raisins",
        "Beginning with the long side, roll the dough tightly into a log shape, and pinch to seal the seam",
        "Cut into 12 equal size pieces",
        "Place the rolls into the prepared pan cut side up",
        "Cover the pan with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes",
        "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes"
