    "summary": "Puffy oven-baked buttery pancake. It's SO easy! You may never make traditional pancakes again. Pour your favorite syrup over it, or just dust powdered sugar on top. There's not much need to add more butter because it's already baked onto the top and forms a delicious salty and buttery crust.",
