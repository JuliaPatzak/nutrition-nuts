    "summary": "This is a great recipe I came up with to get rid of leftover bread. I generally use the contents of my vegetable drawer here so I kind of throw in whatever I have at the time, so you can use your own judgment. They taste really nice when eaten with sour cream or low-fat mayo or even on their own -  though my husband prefers ketchup. I generally use this recipe as a guideline, so have fun with it!",
