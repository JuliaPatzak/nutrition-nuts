        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Lightly grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt\u00ae)",
        "Fit the bottom with a trimmed sheet of parchment paper and lightly grease the parchment",
        "Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl",
        "Whisk beer, buttermilk, and butter together in a separate, small bowl",
        "Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients all at once",
        "Whisk just until the batter is smooth; pour the batter into the prepared pan",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the top gently springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes",
        "While the cake is still warm, run a thin metal spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen it; leave in the pan to cool for 5 minutes",
        "Gently remove the cake and let cool completely on a rack before removing the sheet of parchment",
        "Whip heavy cream, powdered sugar, and whiskey together in a small bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks have formed, about 3 minutes",
        "Serve alongside the cake"
