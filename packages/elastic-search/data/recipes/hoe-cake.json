    "summary": "Hoe cake is a Southern bread that is cooked in an iron skillet, like cornbread.  This recipe stems back to my great-great grandmother.  My father has made this recipe for years, and it is always requested from his grandchildren.  A slice of hoe cake will warm your insides -- slathered with some homemade apple butter alongside of some butter beans, freshly sliced tomatoes and a good tall glass of sweet tea.  I promise your family will love this truly Southern recipe!",
