    "summary": "So I feel like I am using my Instant Pot\u00ae at least 4 times a week. I have been having a great time experimenting and am amazed at the way the flavors are locked in and how quickly the meals are finished... not to say the super easy clean up. The main insert can go in the dishwasher and I hand-clean the top with very sudsy water.",
