    "summary": "For our honeymoon, Aaron and I took a road trip down the east coast. We stopped in Charleston, SC and had shrimp  grits for the first time. OH MAN! It was SOOOO good. Aaron ordered it as appetizer and we liked it so much he got it as an entree too! Since you can't find shrimp and grits on a menu anywhere in Richmond, VA, Aaron came up with his own recipe and topped it off with BBQ sauce. YUM, YUM, YUM!!!",
