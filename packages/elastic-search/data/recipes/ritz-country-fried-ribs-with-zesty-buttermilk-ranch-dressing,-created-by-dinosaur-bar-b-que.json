    "directions": [

        "Put a wire rack over a shallow baking pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan",
        "Season the ribs with a pinch of salt and pepper",
        "Place the ribs on rack, meaty side up",
        "Slide them into the oven and roast slowly",
        "Check every hour or so for doneness",
        "Roast until you can gently tear the meat between the bones, or they reach an internal temperature of 180 degrees F, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours",
        "Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely",
