    "summary": "Every time we visit Springfield, Illinois we have to eat one of their famous horseshoes. The cheese sauce is a little different depending on where you stop to eat, seems everyone has their own way of making it. But we love them all. If you only use one slice of bread and one hamburger patty it is called a ponyshoe. This recipe can also be made with chicken tenders in place of the hamburger patties.",
