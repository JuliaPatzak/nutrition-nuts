    "summary": "I grew up on salmon patties but using fresh salmon and cooking in the air fryer makes all the difference in the world. If made as directed, you don't even need an egg to combine. Serve on toasted buns with fixings of choice, such as mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions, or cheese.",
