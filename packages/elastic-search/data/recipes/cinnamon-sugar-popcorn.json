    "summary": "I first tried this when I was visiting my sister in West Virginia.  After trying it, I loved it, however I neglected to ask her for the recipe.  10 years later, I have it, and I still love it!  The kids can help make it if you use an air popper (which I did to reduce fat and calories...there's enough in the butter!)  I used my deep dish lasagna pan to cook it in the oven.  You can use a roasting pan or any other large, deep dish pan.  It makes a lot, so either invite your friends or store it in an airtight container for later.",
