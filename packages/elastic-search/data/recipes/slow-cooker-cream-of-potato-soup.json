    "summary": "This is an excellent slow-cooker recipe I got from my sister. It's very simple to prepare and easy to adjust with different add-ins and garnishes. I like to add 2 cups of diced cooked vegetables (peas, corn, carrots, beans, broccoli, etc.) and a chopped smoked sausage after the soup is pureed. You can garnish the soup when serving with a little sour cream, cooked, crumbled bacon, grated cheddar cheese, or chopped chives.",
