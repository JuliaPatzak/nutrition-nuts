    "summary": "I used to work where we had a lot of potluck lunches. I just brought the ingredients, already prepared, a rice cooker, and an electric frying pan. I would start the rice about 20 minutes before lunch and cook the rest in the frying pan while everyone else was uncovering and setting out their dishes. My copy of the recipe is getting so tattered I felt I better archive it. I would sorely miss it if lost.",
