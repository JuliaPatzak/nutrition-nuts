    "summary": "This is just a quick salad I came up with from leftovers and loved! I liked the way the arugula paired with the bacon and squash. Add a baguette or a bagel, and it's a great lunch all on it's own! Dress with balsamic vinaigrette or simply oil and vinegar. Feta cheese can be used for the goat cheese, if you prefer.",
