    "summary": "Oregon has more breweries per capita than any other state. As a result, it's no surprise this Oregon-inspired dip includes beer in the recipe! Using your favorite brew (we recommend an IPA), mixed with McCormick\u00ae Cheesy Taco Seasoning Mix and Cheddar and Swiss cheeses, it's tailgate-ready in a half an hour. Pretzels make the perfect dippers, along with crusty bread or chips.",
