    "summary": "You'll love this blend of tomatoes, tuna and black olives in a homemade tomato sauce. My mom would make this during Lent for the family, but you'll want to make it all year round. My husband (who hates tuna), raves about this dish. It's different and very delicious. Tastes even better heated the next day. Serve with some garlic bread and a salad and you have a complete dinner.",
