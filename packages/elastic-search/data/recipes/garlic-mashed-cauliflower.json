    "summary": "This recipe is so easy and healthy. I love mashed potatoes, and when I started the South Beach Diet\u00ae and couldn't have them, I had to find an alternative. This is an awesome alternative, and people who hate vegetables love it. I do recommend using a large food processor for this recipe.",
