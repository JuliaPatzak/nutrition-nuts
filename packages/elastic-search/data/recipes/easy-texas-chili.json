    "summary": "This is a simple recipe for Texas chili I learned from my mother. I like my chili with a little fire to it, but you can adjust this recipe to your liking. This is a chili that only gets better the second day so don't worry about using a large pot and having more than your family can eat the first night because you can have it a couple of nights later. ENJOY. I know I do every time I make this chili.",
