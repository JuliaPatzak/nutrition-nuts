    "summary": "This is a mix of several different recipes to create a hybrid of Thai and Indian curry chicken. It has a bit of a kick to it, but is a very tasty kick of spice. There is also a layer of sweetness, which gives it a good mix of sweet and hot. Served over jasmine rice added another dimension to the flavor.",
