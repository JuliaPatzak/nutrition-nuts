    "summary": "This is a cream cheese dip with a spicy kick. I make a green salsa using tomatillos in the summer, but good tomatillos are hard to find in the winter so I decided to try the same ingredients with a cream cheese base instead. I served it at my Christmas party this year and it was a huge hit; I should have made more! Serve with warm tortilla chips.",
