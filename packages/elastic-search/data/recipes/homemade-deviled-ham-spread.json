    "summary": "I searched for a recipe for this on this site and couldn't find one, so I winged it and it turned out very nicely. I had to make a second batch to take to the New Year's Eve party because the first batch disappeared. A great way to use leftover ham from holiday dinner to make a great spread for hearty crackers or rye toast points. Also good as a sandwich.",
