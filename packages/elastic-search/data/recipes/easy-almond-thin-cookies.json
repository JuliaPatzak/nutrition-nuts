    "summary": "I was looking for a mildly sweet treat to have with tea that wasn't filled with butter or artificial ingredients in general.  These are delicious! They happen to be paleo-friendly as well. The best things really are the simplest. I like coconut sugar because it's less sweet, but any sugar would work. These cookies freeze really well.",
