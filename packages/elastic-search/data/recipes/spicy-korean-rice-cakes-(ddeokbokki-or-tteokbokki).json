    "summary": "This is a very hot and spicy snack eaten all over Korea in homes and at food stands in the street. It consists of a lovely red sauce and chewy rice cakes which look like very thick, short noodles. If you're a spice lover and want to try a new texture, I would highly recommend this ddokboki, which we made with the kids at my school. It is always done to taste: some sweet, some hot, some with heavy garlic. You can imagine the variety we got with so many kids cooking it. Either way it is a definite Korean comfort food that you can experience with a quick trip to your Asian grocery store.",
