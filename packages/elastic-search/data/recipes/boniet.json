    "summary": "Pronounced 'bun-yet,' this is an old world Italian recipe from my Nonie's kitchen. It is made using mainly parsley and garlic and is meant to be eaten with a crusty warm bread. It is almost sinful to share it's secret with the world but I know you'll love it as much as my family and I do. Refrigerate overnight for best flavor.",
