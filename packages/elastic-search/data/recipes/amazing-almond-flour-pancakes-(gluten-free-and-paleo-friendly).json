    "summary": "While trying many of the grain free pancake ideas out there, I discovered that many pancake recipes are just too 'eggy' or include bananas in the recipe. A lot of the recipes resulted in pancakes that were too flat and broke apart when flipping. I wanted a recipe that was like the Aunt Jemima\u00ae pancakes I grew up with: delicious and fluffy. After much experimentation with recipes and reading forum comments, I finally put together something reminiscent of childhood quality pancakes. Top with maple syrup and fresh fruit.",
