    "summary": "Of course this will work with any type of caviar. Having said that, when you consider value, it's hard to beat these golden beads. Trout roe has a fresh, clean, briny flavor, and an absolutely beautiful texture. The feeling of those little, subtly salty eggs popping on your tongue is one of life's great food experiences.",
