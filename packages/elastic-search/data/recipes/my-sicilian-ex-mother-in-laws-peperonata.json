    "summary": "Camilla's version of a Sicilian \"contorno\" (meatless side dish) made with bell peppers, onion, garlic, and fresh herbs. It's usually made in large quantities so there will be leftovers to toss with either pasta or rice the next day. It can be made either in the oven or on the stovetop. This is the stovetop version. This is even better the next day!",
