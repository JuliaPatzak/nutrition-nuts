    "summary": "A dish of either German or possibly Polish origin, made special by my mother, grandmother, her mother before her, etc.  The men will love this one, too, and the beer broth is nothing short of amazing.  I like to use whatever is in the fridge. Ales, lagers, and wheat brews work best.  Did I mention this is an incredibly easy, one-pot dish that kids love? Hope you like it!",
