    "summary": "These appetizers are easy to make and very addictive. I have converted tomato-haters to lovers of these BLT cups. I love that they can be made ahead of time and then a quick spoonful in a cup to serve. You can never make too many - they will fly in a second. The BLT mix can be made in advance and kept refrigerated. Remove from fridge 1/2 hour before serving. You can use butter instead of olive oil, if desired.",
