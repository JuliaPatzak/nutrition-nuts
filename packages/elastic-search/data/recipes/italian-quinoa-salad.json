    "summary": "I created this recipe when I ran out of pasta and needed to make a quick salad for a potluck. This versatile recipe has become one of our favorites for taking to picnics and for eating after a workout. Eat immediately or refrigerate 2 hours to overnight for best flavor. Quinoa really soaks up the dressing, so you may want to add more to taste after the refrigeration period.",
