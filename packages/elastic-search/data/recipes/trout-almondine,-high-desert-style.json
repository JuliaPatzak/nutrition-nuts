    "summary": "I call this dish 'high-desert trout,' as it has become a mainstay in my culinary arsenal inspired by a brunch stop at a beatnik bungalow in the middle of nowhere set in the pristine high desert of 29 Palms, California, known as the 29 Palms Oasis Inn. A fan favorite with friends and family over the years and it gives me a good excuse to go trout fishing! The tomato and caper saute provides a palate-pleasing twist on the traditional trout almondine.",
