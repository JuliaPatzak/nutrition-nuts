    "summary": "These deep fried fritters are amazing! They may sound a little different, but they are  remarkably easy to make and will take you way down South.  Serve with cayenne butter (melted butter with some cayenne added), or with cayenne aioli (mayonnaise with fresh garlic and cayenne pepper in it).  Try garnishing with thinly sliced green onions.  Enjoy!",
