    "summary": "Diced chicken breast is draped in a creamy sauce with green onions and peppers plus tarragon for the finishing touch. Enjoy a delicious, comforting chicken dish as well as a reminder on how to make cream sauce--it's easier than you thought. I serve this over bread, but any starchy base will do. Garnish with green onions if desired.",
