        "In a large skillet, brown entire pound of bacon until crisp, placing cooked strips on paper towels to absorb grease",
        "For best results, finely chop bacon in a food processor or with a hand blender, but finely chopping by hand will also work",

        "Add half the container of sour cream, blend well",
        "Add more sour cream by spoonfuls, until the mixture isn't overwhelmed by the taste of mayonnaise (you'll be left with about a cup or so of sour cream,  typically)",

        "Add a dash of salt and pepper to taste",
