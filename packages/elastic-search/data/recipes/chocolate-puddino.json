    "summary": "Perfect for Valentine's Day, this rich and delicious chocolate pudding is made with a classic Italian method that they call \"budino.\" The pudding has a glorious texture--firm enough to stay on the spoon and hold its shape, but at the same time, soft, smooth, and silky. It's a perfect balance between intense chocolate flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness, topped with a soft whipped cream topping that elevates it to a whole new level of amazingness!",
