    "summary": "This recipe is similar to an appetizer served at my favorite Italian restaurant. It is a nice change from the usual appetizers and always gets rave reviews! I have used tenderloin in the past, but have found that a good quality top sirloin works very well and is less expensive. Bernaise sauce is a good alternative if you don't like blue cheese.",
