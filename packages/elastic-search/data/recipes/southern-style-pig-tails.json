    "summary": "A lot of ethnic recipes use pig tails. They are great as a meat dish with turnip greens, black-eyed peas, or boiled cabbage.  My recipe cooks the tails, twice and the result is a crispy crackling covering the tail, that you can eat or save for crackling in cornbread.  The crushed red pepper can be used liberally for a spicy taste.  Be sure to buy pig tails that have a lot of meat around the upper part.",
