    "summary": "These are inspired by a dim sum item I had from a fancy Asian-fusion restaurant in Manhattan. They're delicious served with a simple broth and have a silky, savory edamame filling inside. They are time consuming, but relatively easy to make. You can make them ahead of time and freeze them for future use. The dumplings are meant to be steamed or boiled but taste great deep fried as well. Garnish with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and sliced green onion.",
