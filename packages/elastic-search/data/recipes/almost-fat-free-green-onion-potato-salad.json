    "summary": "Potato salad is the first food I can remember eating. Since it was my first culinary memory I am very particular about how I like my potato salad made. Basically, there's my mom's recipe, which is perfect, and every other version. So while I usually don't stray from what I consider 'real' potato salad, once in a while I will mix it up and try something new.",
