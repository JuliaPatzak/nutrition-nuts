    "summary": "This recipe calls for 4 pork chops because that's about what you can fit into a standard frying pan, though I've squeezed 6 smaller chops in before. I recommend you double the recipe because my husband eats them two at a time. Serve the smothered pork chops over cooked rice with your favorite vegetable side dish and cornbread.",
