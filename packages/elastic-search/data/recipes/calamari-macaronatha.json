    "summary": "This is the 'easy' version of the classic Greek dish macaronatha, which is octopus meat in a delicious tomato-based sauce over macaroni, topped with grated sheep's milk cheese. Squid is easier to obtain, and is usually sold already cleaned, thus the ease. Goes well with a fruity blush wine like white Zinfandel. Enjoy!",
