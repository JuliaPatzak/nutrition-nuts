    "summary": "This homemade snack mix recipe my mom has had since it originated in the 1940s. This was always a holiday favorite at our house. So much better than the newer versions with a richer flavor with the extra butter. This is a very hard-to-find recipe so I thought I'd share. Great to put in tins and give away. I always quadruple the recipe and store extra in freezer. Store in an airtight container or large zip-top bags.",
