    "summary": "This recipe is based on the sloppy joes I loved as a kid. My own kids don't eat enough veggies, so I added them to this recipe and they pass the kid-approved test. This recipe was entered in our school's cookbook and has been a big hit for a quick weeknight supper. Equally tasty with ground turkey.",
