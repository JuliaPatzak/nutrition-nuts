    "summary": "Buffalo wings with an extreme kick! I have a couple friends who like spicy foods, and I was elected to come up with a hot wing for a football party. This recipe can be made hotter if you can find ghost chillies or ghost chilli sauce in replacement of the habanero, and the pineapple adds just enough to keep you coming back for more. The wings are a hit, even without the sauce! Serve with ranch or blue cheese dressing.",
