    "summary": "This soup is so easy to make and tastes so good. You can blend it smooth or leave it chunky. You can top with a dollop of sour cream or plain Greek yogurt if you wish. I created this recipe after my nephew's food service class served a very similar version at their 'Big Night' dinner.",
