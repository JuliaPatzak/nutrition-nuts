    "summary": "This year I learned to not only catch my own fish, but to clean, cook and eat them as well. Thrilling. This recipe is my recreation of a dish that was made by a man named Botsy, years ago, in the Rocky Mountains. It's delicious and enhances fresh trout without overpowering it. These could also be prepared in foil packets on a camping trip over an open fire. Although we camp, I don't often include a bottle of sherry in my kitchen box. When you add the sherry, pour a glass for yourself.",
