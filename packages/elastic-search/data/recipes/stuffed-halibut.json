    "summary": "These halibut fillets are stuffed with a mixture of cream cheese and salad shrimp. If the thick filets are not available, you can spread the cream cheese mixture on top of the thinner filets and fold in half, using a tooth pick to keep in place during cooking. The fresher the fish for this recipe, the better!  This is great served with fresh steamed broccoli.",
