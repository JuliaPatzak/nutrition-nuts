    "summary": "This is a wonderful summer salad. Fresh herbs keep the salad light, while the chicken and feta cheese make it hearty enough to serve for a main meal. Use as a side dish by omitting the chicken and adding chopped artichoke hearts. The salad also works wonderfully with grilled salmon or chicken.",
