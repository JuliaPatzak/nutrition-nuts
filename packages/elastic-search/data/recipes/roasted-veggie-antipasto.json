    "summary": "This is a delicious recipe and keeps for a long time, due to hot water bath processing. Great little jars for picnics, hostess gifts and entertaining. Scrumptious with crackers and cream cheese. I like mine a little on the sweet side and will occasionally add 1/4 cup brown sugar to the mix or use a sweet BBQ sauce. Alter the veggies as you like, trying to keep the overall quantity about the same.",
