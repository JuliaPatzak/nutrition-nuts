    "summary": "A local winery/restaurant serves a stuffed eggplant appetizer that is so delicious.  While trying to duplicate it at home, I found this to be one of our favorite eggplant dinners.  Be sure to select an eggplant that is smooth, blemish-free and kind of heavy for it's size. Serve with a green salad.",
