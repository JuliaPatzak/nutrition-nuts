    "summary": "I have an enormous family and all of the men go trail riding several times a year and these beans are one of the things they look forward to. My aunts and I put together their favorite combination several years ago, and have it ready at their camp, and they are some happy cowboys! You can mix different beans to your liking (lima, kidney, etc.), but the boys in our family like this mixture the best.",
