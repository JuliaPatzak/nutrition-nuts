    "summary": "Air fryers are taking over kitchens nationwide. They're basically mini convection ovens that 'fry' foods with little to no oil, less fat, and fewer calories. A heating element and fan bathe the food in hot air to produce a crispy finished product. Use 2 to 3 cups of assorted vegetable pieces, cut 1/2-inch thick. Serve with desired dipping sauce.",
