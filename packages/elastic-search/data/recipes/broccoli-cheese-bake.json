    "summary": "This is a great casserole that I threw together one day when a friend requested Broccoli au Gratin for her birthday dinner.  This is a great idea for those who aren't big fans of bread crumbs.  Also, the eggs can be taken out for a great sauce and using skim milk and fat-free cheese works well, too.  It's basically a great recipe that can be easily altered according to taste. Enjoy!",
