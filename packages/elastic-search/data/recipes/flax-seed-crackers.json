    "summary": "I heard that if you mix flax seeds with an equal amount of water, soak them, and spread them thin, you'll get a tasty cracker. I heard right! These have a nutty, earthy flavor. They're light, but still sturdy enough for dips and spreads. Experiment with other seasonings if you like.",
