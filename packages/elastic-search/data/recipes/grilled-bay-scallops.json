    "summary": "Growing up in Florida, our family would take our boat out in Tampa Bay and gather scallops. When we returned home, my father would grill them with butter. I think this is the best way to enjoy bay scallops because grilling really brings out their sweet flavor. Serve with extra butter and a lemon wedge.",
