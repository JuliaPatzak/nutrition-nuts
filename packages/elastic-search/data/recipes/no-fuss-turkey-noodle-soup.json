    "summary": "Make good use of your leftover dark meat without the fuss of boiling the carcass. Simply pick through the carcass before you toss the bird and save the meat for a quick next-day soup. Serve with warm bread for a great hot meal on a cold winter day. I substitute fresh herbs wherever possible, but for a quick meal after the intense preparation of a whole turkey, dried herbs do nicely. If you don't have chipotle chili powder, regular chili powder can be substituted. The chipotle provides a very light smoky flavor in the background. White meat can be used, but your broth will be less flavorful. Leftovers freeze well. Use whatever type pasta you prefer.",
