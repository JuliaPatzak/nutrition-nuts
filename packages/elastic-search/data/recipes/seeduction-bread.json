    "summary": "Hearty wheat bread with nutty flavor and lots of good tasting seeds. All the seeds and the Vital Wheat Gluten were available at my local health food store. The Malted Flour was not available. I purchased malted barley seed at the local brewery supply store and ground the seeds to flour in a coffee grinder. The seeds come in various roasts.  I purchased the number 10. The higher numbers become stronger and darker. Malted wheat seeds are also available at the Supply store. I have not made the recipe with the wheat.",
