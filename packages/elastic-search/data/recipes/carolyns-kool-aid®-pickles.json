    "summary": "The kids I babysit for love these -- red Kool Aid gives ordinary pickles a bright red color and adds fruity sweetness to their normal tang.  I'm told they originated in the Southern US. I've also heard they are bar snacks, which may explain a lot.  They are pretty, but I have to admit that I don't care for them very much.",
