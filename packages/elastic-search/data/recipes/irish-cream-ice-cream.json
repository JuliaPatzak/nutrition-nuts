    "summary": "I LOVE Irish cream ice cream, so when I got my own ice cream maker I went looking for a recipe to duplicate it. To my horror after an extensive search of the internet I could only fine one, and it was WAY to large for my 2-quart maker. So I came up with one of my own. The result was a surprisingly good substitute for the expensive brand! Because of the liqueur it takes a bit longer to harden than the recipes without liqueur, but the wait is worth it!",
