    "summary": "I based this homemade iced coffee on Starbucks\u00ae bottled Frappuccino\u00ae. My husband and I love it and our fridge is never without a pitcher of this super easy, frugal alternative to the expensive stuff. Even though winter's coming and we live in Pennsylvania's Lake Erie snowbelt, we drink this year-round as an alternative to soda and other soft drinks. This particular recipe lends itself to endless variations limited only by your imagination!",
