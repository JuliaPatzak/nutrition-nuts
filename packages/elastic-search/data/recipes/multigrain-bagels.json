    "summary": "I added flaxseed meal, wheat germ, rolled oats, and whole wheat flour to a recipe I adapted from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The recipe yields 16 bagels that won't 'get lost' in your toaster. These bagels are best served toasted. My kids love them topped with cream cheese and thin layer of strawberry jam. Store in a resealable plastic bag.",
