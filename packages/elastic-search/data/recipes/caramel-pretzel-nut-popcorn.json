        "In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter",
        "Cook, stirring to melt the butter and dissolve the sugar, until the mixture comes to a boil",
        "Once the mixture is at a full boil, continue to cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly",
        "Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt, vanilla, and baking soda",

        "Shake until evenly coated",
        "For a crispier treat, boil the sugar mixture longer, or bake the finished mix in the oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes"
