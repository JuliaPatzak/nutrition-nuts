    "summary": "I'm tired of buying this at the store, so I decided to make my own. In my opinion, this is the best way to prepare potatoes for a typical breakfast. This recipe lasts a long time in the freezer. Just pull the bag out of the freezer and toss as much as you want onto a hot pan or griddle. Add more vegetable oil when cooking if needed. Enjoy.",
