    "summary": "Taramosalata is a classic Greek appetizer (meze). Satisfyingly delicious, it goes a long way as a party nibble and is also nice to have in the fridge for a quick lunch with some olives and a salad on the side. Fish roe is high in Omega 3 and Vitamin B12, and this is a great way to enjoy it.",
