    "summary": "I started experimenting with making my own granola bars because the store-bought bars were too sugary. I wanted a mildly sweet, vegan, chewy granola bar that doesn't crumble and this is it! As you can see, the ingredients are flexible to adapt to your taste, and as long as you don't exceed the amounts and press the mixture well into the pan, you'll have a yummy snack that doesn't fall apart! The sweetness comes from the dried fruit and brown rice syrup, which makes this recipe unique among others that use additional brown or white sugar and butter.",
