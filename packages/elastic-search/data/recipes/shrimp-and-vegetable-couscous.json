    "summary": "The amazing thing about couscous is how fast it 'cooks' and how versatile it is. This is one of those recipes that should give you lots of ideas to create your own combinations. By the way, this is the 'home' version; the traditional method used to cook this dish uses a steamer called a kiska, sometimes called a couscoussier in French cuisine. Garnish with lemon.",
