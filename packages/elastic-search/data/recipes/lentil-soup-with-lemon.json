    "directions": [
        "Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat",
        "Stir in the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion has turned golden brown, about 5 minutes",
        "Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, kosher salt, black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon of chili powder",

        "Stir in the chicken broth, lentils, and carrot",
        "Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are soft, about 30 minutes",
        "Pour half of the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree",

        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot",
        "Do not puree all of the soup, leave it a little chunky",
        "Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, then season to taste with salt",
        "Drizzle with olive oil and a sprinkle of chili powder to serve"
