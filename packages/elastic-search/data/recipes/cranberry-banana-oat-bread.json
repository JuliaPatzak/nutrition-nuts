    "summary": "A fun twist on banana bread. The cranberries add a sweet and tart flavor that really kicks up the flavor of this bread. Super moist and super flavorful, it's a great addition to brunch! If you like more of a buttery taste, try brushing the top of the baked loaf with a pastry brush and a little bit of melted butter.",
