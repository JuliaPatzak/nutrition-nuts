    "summary": "A different version of the commonly seen appetizer of scallops wrapped in bacon.  Using prosciutto allows for the subtle flavors of this meat to come through without overpowering the wonderful flavor of the scallops.  Additionally, the fat content and grease is significantly less than bacon for those that are health conscious.  I serve this for guests as an appetizer and people love it.  It can be made into a main course dish by increase the portion for each person.",
