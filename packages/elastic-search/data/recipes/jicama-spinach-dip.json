    "summary": "I love spinach dip. The crunch of water chestnuts is good but there is just something about them I do not care for. Also, too much spinach I do not like, so I altered a few things from others I have made and found one I just love! It is not too spinach-y. I love the crunch from the jicama and red bell pepper. Took this to a party and it was a hit! I served in round sourdough bread bowl with variety of bread, crackers, and veggies. Enjoy!",
