    "summary": "I had this at a tapas bar in Spain way back and was able to figure out how to mimic it.  It's an easy way to clean out the fridge and pantry.  And, perfect for a low carb diet.  I was introduced to this as a tapa.  But you could always pair it with a salad or other veggie side dish for dinner.",
