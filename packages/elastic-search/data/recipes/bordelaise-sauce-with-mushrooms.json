    "summary": "I used to visit the restaurant of a friend who was a chef. He made the best mushroom sauce for beef, but would not share his recipe. After trial and error, I think mine comes very close to his. This haute cuisine sauce makes everyday steaks or roasts into something a little more elegant. Serve atop grilled steaks, hamburger steaks, roasted beef or venison. Bon Appetite!",
