    "summary": "When we lived in Barcelona we used to eat this all the time. Warning! Everyone has to eat this. If you don't the garlic smell will drive you out of the room. We bought a garlic jar in Spain for seasoning the garlic to make the taste a bit more concentrated. It's basically a ceramic jar with holes in the back to keep the garlic out of the light so it doesn't sprout, but the holes in the back allow the garlic to dry, in order to concentrate the flavor. It works fantastic and keeps garlic for 2 to 3 months.",
