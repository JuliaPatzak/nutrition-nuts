    "summary": "This is a good way to use up some leftover Italian bread -- or any bread for that matter. Fresh mozzarella melted over vine ripe tomatoes and basil, then drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Yummy! A nice glass of red wine and you're in heaven! Enjoy with a nice salad or a cup of soup; makes a lovely lunch or afternoon snack.",
