    "summary": "My inspiration for this splendid recipe came from a dish on the menu at Longhorn\u00ae Steakhouse. I've guessed how it's made and decided to add strawberries to the salsa, but I am sure it will be fine with just pineapples. Strawberry preserves serve as the marinade base, mixed with soy, vinegar, and sesame oil.",
