    "summary": "I made these sausage and scallion egg muffins for Better Connecticut during my Cook Once Meals All Week series! The best part of these egg muffins is you can use any of your favorite fillings. I love to use leftover sausage, zucchini, spinach, and tomatoes. These are great to freeze and just quickly microwave for your on-the-go breakfast. For those following the Paleo diet or are gluten free, these are the perfect recipe for you! Make a salad and enjoy for lunch or dinner!",
