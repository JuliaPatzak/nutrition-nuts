    "summary": "I just wasn't satisfied with the ingredients in other cheese ball recipes. So, I made my own and took it to a Christmas party, where it was enjoyed by all. You can also experiment with other Greek-themed ingredient options such as sun-dried tomatoes, Kalamata or green olives, pepperoncini, etc. Surround cheese balls with your favorite crackers.  For a true 'Greek' theme, try toasted pita chips.",
