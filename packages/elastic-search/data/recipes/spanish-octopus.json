    "summary": "Above and beyond the ingredients, the cooking method, or should I say methods, couldn't be easier. As long as you braise it gently on low heat, until just tender, and then give it a nice sear before serving, you should be in great shape.\u00a0This smoky braised octopus is great served with crusty roasted potatoes.",
