    "summary": "A to-die-for take on the usual olive tapenade. Don't use California sundried tomatoes because they are too sweet! Every time I make this I get requests for the recipe! I've never actually had the patience to chill this and always end up serving it right away. It's a huge hit! Serve with your favorite crackers.",
