    "summary": "This corned beef and knockwurst sandwich recipe is an original from my hometown of Richmond, Virginia. Cooked on the griddle, it was created at Richmond's own NY Deli in the 1940's, and soon became a staple of diners and bars across the city. Crazy that it's still completely unknown anywhere else.",
