    "summary": "I thought that sweet potato tots would be a fun way to add some sweet earthy flavor to grilled cheese. Once I had the sweetness, I added some bacon for saltiness, and used Roth\u00ae Sriracha Gouda for a kick! The sandwiches came out amazing with tons of gooey spicy cheese oozing out of every bite.",
