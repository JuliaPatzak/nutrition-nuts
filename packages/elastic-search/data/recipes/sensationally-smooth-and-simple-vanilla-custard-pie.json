    "summary": "At first glance it may seem as if there are a lot of steps for this vanilla custard pie but really it is very simple with \u201cstaple\u201d ingredients. The steps are for clarification. Basically it's just heating milk and whisking it into egg mixture very slowly, then bake for about an hour\u2026 It is my most requested pie.
