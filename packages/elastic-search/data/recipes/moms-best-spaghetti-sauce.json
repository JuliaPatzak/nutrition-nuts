    "summary": "A simple, slow cooked, authentic spaghetti sauce, as good as the restaurants serve...or better!  The secret ingredient is baking soda, but do not taste the sauce right after adding it.  Wait a while, and this sauce will not disappoint you.  It is good right from the stove, but the flavors blend overnight.  Best served with your favorite meatball recipe, where the meatballs cook in the sauce the last half hour.  Be prepared to take a nap after eating.",
