    "summary": "This is a great quick meal; the chicken and sauce can be prepared in the time it takes to cook the pasta. You can add more cream or less pasta if you like it creamier. Try ziti or farfalle pasta to add even more variety to this recipe. The leftovers don't heat very well, so eat it all up the first time!",
