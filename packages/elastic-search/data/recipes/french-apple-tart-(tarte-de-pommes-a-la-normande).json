    "summary": "My mother used to cook this for us all, usually to go with Sunday dinner.  I was hooked.  Haven't had it in ages and I was wanting to bake something special for a special someone so I asked mum for the recipe.  Tried it out today, and it's just as I remember.  The thing that makes it for me is the frangipane.  Hope you like it as much as me.",

    "directions": [
        "In a medium bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups of  flour and salt",
        "Add the butter, 1 egg yolk and water, and stir until the mixture forms large crumbs",
        "If it is too dry to press a handful together, stir in more water",
        "Press the dough into a ball, and wrap in plastic wrap",
        "Flatten slightly, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until firm",
        "This part can be done up to three days in advance",
        "To make the frangipane, cream together the butter and 1/2 cup of sugar in a medium bowl until light and soft",
        "Gradually mix in the egg and the remaining egg yolk one at a time",
        "Stir in the apple brandy",
        "Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into the ground almonds, then mix into the batter",
        "Set aside",
        "Roll the pastry dough out to about a 12 inch circle on a lightly floured surface",
        "Fold loosely into quarters, and center the point in a 10 inch tart or pie pan",

        "Spoon the frangipane into the chilled pastry, and spread into an even layer",
        "Arrange the apple slices in an overlapping spiral pattern",
        "Each slice should have one edge pressed into the frangipane until it touches the pastry base, and then overlap the previous slice",
        "Start at the outside edge, and work towards the center",
        "Place the pie plate on top of the baking sheet in the preheated oven",
        "Bake for 15 minutes, or until the filling begins to brown",
