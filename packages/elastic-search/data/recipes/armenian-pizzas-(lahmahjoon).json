    "summary": "This is a dish my Uncle is famous for, but he has never written the recipe down.  Through years of trial and error, I think I have pretty much got it as close as I can!  Don't be too exact with your spices though, just flavor as you go to your own tastes--personally, I never measure mine out.  These pizzas are great to put in the fridge overnight and grab as a quick lunch the next day with a dollop of plain yogurt on top!",
