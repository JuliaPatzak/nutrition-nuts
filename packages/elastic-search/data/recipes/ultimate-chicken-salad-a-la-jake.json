    "summary": "Best chicken salad I ever had- a little homemade Aioli mayo with chicken, sun-dried tomato, olive and thyme.  Great on sandwiches or on romaine lettuce. This recipe adapts to various tastes well- for instance, it  goes great with crumbled bacon, minced red onion, touch of sage, or red wine vinegar instead of the aioli.",
