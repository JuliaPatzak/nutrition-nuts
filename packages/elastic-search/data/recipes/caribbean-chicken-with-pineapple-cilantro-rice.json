        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Mix together the light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, thyme, cumin, 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, paprika, chili powder, and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined",
        "Rub both sides of chicken breasts with the spice mixture, and place into a 9x9-inch baking dish",

        "Mix the chopped pineapple, cilantro, and olive oil into the cooked rice, and season to taste with a pinch or two of garlic salt and black pepper",
        "Fluff the rice up with a fork, and transfer to a serving platter",
        "Serve with the baked chicken, topped with remaining pineapple slices"
