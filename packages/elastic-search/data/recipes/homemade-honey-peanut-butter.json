    "summary": "I decided to start making my own peanut butter when I read the ingredient list on a peanut butter jar label. While peanuts are good for you, the unhealthy additives and hydrogenated oils are not. This is all natural with no preservatives and has a much better flavor than store-bought peanut butter. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.",
