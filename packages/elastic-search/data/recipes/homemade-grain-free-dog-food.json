    "summary": "My dog is getting older and his health has become more of a priority. I worry about how many nutrients kibble may lose through the cooking process. So, I developed this homemade dog food recipe to include all of the vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids that my dog needs. It took me a bit of research to figure out what foods in what proportions to use. The protein ingredients include liver and poultry (dark meat poultry is best), sunflower oil for linoleic acid, and 10 other essential amino acids that dogs must get in their diet.",
