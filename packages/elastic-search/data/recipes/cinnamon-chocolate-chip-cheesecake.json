    "summary": "This is a show-stopper dessert! The cheesecake is so creamy and luscious, studded with chocolate chips and a faint cinnamon flavor. The mascarpone here takes a little edge off of the tang from the cream cheese. The ganache, speculoos cookies, and Hershey's\u00ae kisses take it over the top. Perfect for a party!",
