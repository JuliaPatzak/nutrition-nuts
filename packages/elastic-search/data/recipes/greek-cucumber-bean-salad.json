    "summary": "I make this salad to last all week for my work lunch. It's very versatile in that you could add different types of beans or even a different flavor dressing to your taste. I like to use enough Kalamata olives that I have one in almost every bite! You could easily cut this recipe in half to serve for dinner.",
