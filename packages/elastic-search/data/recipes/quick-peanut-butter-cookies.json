    "summary": "I had to make cookies at the last minute for a school function and  a friend gave me this quick and easy recipe. From start to finish, this only takes about 30-45 minutes and the taste is like you spent  hours in the kitchen. You might want to make a double batch, because  they will be gone before you know it. ENJOY!!",
