    "summary": "Serve this delicious sauce with falafel in pita or with fresh vegetables. Best if made a few hours in advance, but it can be served immediately. I chop the garlic, and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. This increases the amount of allicin, a compound shown to have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal activity.",
