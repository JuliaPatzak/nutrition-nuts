    "summary": "This is a southern tavern with just a bit of a mild kick. You can add more heat by doubling the chili powder and cayenne pepper and adding a few of the seeds from the jalapeno. You can use beef, too! You can serve these on burger buns, in tortillas or in pitas garnished with with some shredded cheddar, pickled jalapeno slices and chipotle mayo. (If you have a more classic taste, American cheese, pickles and ketchup still tastes good as well!)",
