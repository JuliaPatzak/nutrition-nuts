    "summary": "Cannoli are Italian pastries consisting of tube-shaped shells of fried pastry dough, filled with a sweet, creamy filling usually containing ricotta--a staple of Sicilian cuisine. This is a cheesecake inspired by the flavors of a traditional cannoli. Serve with a big glass of cold milk! This would last several days, covered, in the refrigerator.",
