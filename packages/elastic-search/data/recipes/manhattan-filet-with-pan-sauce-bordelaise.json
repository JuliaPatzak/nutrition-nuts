    "summary": "This simple technique not only provides you with a NY strip steak that eats like a filet mignon, but the trimmings are used to make a world-class pan sauce. Even if a faux-bordelaise isn't your cup of tea, you can always save the scraps for a Sunday sauce or meatballs. The overnight 'dry-aging' step is optional, but does add a little something extra to the final product.",
