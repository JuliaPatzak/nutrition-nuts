    "summary": "My mother-in-law passed down this very old recipe to my wife. The first time she made it, I was completely surprised. I had never heard of it, and I've been unable to find anything else quite like it. You can fix this as a side dish to a meal, or make it into muffins for snacks. Either way, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
