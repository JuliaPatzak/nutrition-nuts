    "summary": "The coconut, curry, and mango chutney really put the flavor in this one. I put this together one night with what I had, and loved the results. It tastes better the next day, just like most chili. This freezes well. Seriously, you have to try it.  Serve by itself, with rice, and/or with naan bread.",
