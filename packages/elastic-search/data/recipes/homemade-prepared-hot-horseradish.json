        "Place diced horseradish in a food processor; add a splash of cold water",

        "Continue blending, adding a bit more water if mixture seems too dry",
        "Process until horseradish is finely ground",
        "Wait 2 minutes before adding the vinegar and salt; supposedly this makes the horseradish hotter",
