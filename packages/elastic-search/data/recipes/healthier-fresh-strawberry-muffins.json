    "summary": "This is my two-year-old's favorite fresh strawberry muffin recipe! While it's a sweet muffin, the ingredients are healthy enough that I feel good about giving her one for breakfast. They only last a couple of days fresh, but freeze beautifully - I usually put half in the freezer right away and enjoy them for months!",
