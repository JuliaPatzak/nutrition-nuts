    "summary": "Yet another crustless quiche that is designed for a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet. It is very rich and cheesy. The Parmesan and butter on the bottom form a nice skin on the bottom that really helps. The egg and cream mixture is quite flexible and the ratio of egg to cream and the heaviness of the cream is a personal choice. The cheese can easily be replaced with any hard cheese that holds up well when shredded such as Swiss, Cheddar, Gouda, or Provolone. The meats can be replaced with anything that isn't too wet; whether it is meat or vegetable.",
