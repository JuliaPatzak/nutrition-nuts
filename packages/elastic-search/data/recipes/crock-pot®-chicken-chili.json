    "summary": "Made a chicken chili recipe, and it was bland. So I took the ingredients and added my own flair. My family loves it when it gets cold out, because they know this will be on the menu. It's very flavorful. Serve with tortilla chips and sliced avocado for something different. Serve with sour cream and cheese.",
