    "summary": "My hubby just found out he's gluten-intolerant, so I set about turning some of his fave recipes gluten-free. This recipe was originally a little cake recipe, but he always preferred these to real blueberry muffins. These are so good you can't even tell the difference between the real recipe and the gluten-free recipe! I prefer these with finely chopped canned peaches instead of the blueberries, so I usually make 6 peach and 6 blueberry. Hope you enjoy!",
