    "summary": "This blackened shrimp salad bowl is big and bold in flavor and makes for a low-calorie meal packed with shrimp, brown rice, corn, crisp bell pepper, black beans, and avocado. Easy to create with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen/pantry. If you prefer to serve burrito-style, just heat up some flour tortillas and wrap it all up. Either way, it's delish!",
