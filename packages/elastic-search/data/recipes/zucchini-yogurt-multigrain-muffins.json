    "summary": "I tried finding a recipe to get my picky toddler to eat her vegetables. Since I couldn't find a healthy one, I came up with this. Using one cup carrots and one cup zucchini is a nice way to get both the yellow and green veggies into the diet! Any type of nuts, raisins, etc. may be used in the recipe -- whatever is on hand and toddler approved.",
