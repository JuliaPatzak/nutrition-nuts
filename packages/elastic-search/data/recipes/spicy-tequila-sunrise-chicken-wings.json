    "summary": "This is a recipe that I made up for a bunch of hungry guys that where watching football one afternoon with my husband. They loved them so much that they actually paid more attention to the wings than the game for 15 minutes! For milder sauce use mild chili sauce instead of Thai. Serve with celery and ranch or blue cheese dressing.",
