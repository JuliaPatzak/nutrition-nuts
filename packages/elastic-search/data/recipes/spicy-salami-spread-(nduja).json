    "summary": "I'm not saying this spicy salami spread is as good as traditional nduja, but it does take about 3 months' less time to make while still delivering most of the characteristics that make the Calabrian delicacy so amazing. And just in case you're not familiar with nduja, a few of those characteristics are a rich, spicy, super-savory flavor, and soft, luxurious texture. Present as a self-serve spread next to toasted bread or top with herbs for a crostini appetizer.",
