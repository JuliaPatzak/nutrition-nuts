    "summary": "Tofu Miso Tahini is a delectable vegan sandwich filling. You can replace the sunflower seeds with sesame seeds if you prefer. You'll never want tuna or chicken salad again!!! Try TMT on an open-faced, toasted bagel with ripe tomato slices, on a seed-laden, whole wheat bread with lettuce and sweet onion, or on rye crackers as an hors d'oeurve, garnished with fine slices of vegetables.",
