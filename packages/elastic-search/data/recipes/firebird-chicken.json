    "summary": "Usually when I steal a dish from someone, I steal both the recipe and the name - but not this time. The original firebird chicken is actually a stir-fry dish, and quite a bit different from what you're seeing here. But I absolutely love the name and thought it would fit perfectly for this very simple, extremely spicy, and incredibly delicious dish. Serve with finely chopped fresh chives.",
