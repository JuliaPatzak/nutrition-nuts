    "summary": "It may not be the most beautiful dish, but it is an easy and delicious avocado soup base that can be served warm, room temperature, or even cold. Pass around a plate or two of the mix-ins and let people put what they want in their individual bowl. Everyone I make this for loves this soup, even my 3 small children. Excellent for a casual summer get together, and easily doubled. Serve with tortilla chips.",
