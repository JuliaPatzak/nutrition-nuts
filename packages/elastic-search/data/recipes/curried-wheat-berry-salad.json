    "summary": "Delicious, Mediterranean-influenced salad. It's a healthy whole food salad that can be eaten as a main dish or side dish. Eat immediately or chill for several hours.  I think it gets better after sitting for a few hours, as the raisins soften up and the wheat berries absorb some spice.  Eat up!",
