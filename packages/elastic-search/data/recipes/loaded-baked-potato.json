        "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F",
        "Pierce each potato with a paring knife and roast in the oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes",

        "Heat a saute pan over medium heat and cook the bacon until crispy, about 7 minutes",

        "Cook the broccoli and red pepper for 2 minutes",
        "Add the water and allow to cook until water has evaporated",
        "Remove from heat",
        "When potatoes are done cooking, remove and allow to cool until you can handle them",
