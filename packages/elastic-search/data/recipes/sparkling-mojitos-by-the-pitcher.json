    "summary": "Most mixed drink recipes are for individual drinks but this recipe is great for a small group. When I need to mix the recipe in advance, I mix everything but the sparkling water, which can be added right before serving. It's a delicious and refreshing recipe, perfect for a summer dinner party or back yard barbeque. Serve over ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and/or slice of lime.",
