    "summary": "A smooth hummus with a kick, great for a healthy snack and quick and easy to make. The dried jalapeno can be found in your local grocery store and looks like dried parsley. Add sun-dried tomatoes or roasted red pepper if you want to change up the flavor, but this is completely optional. Garnish with a sprig of parsley and serve with pita bread or as a dip for veggies!",
