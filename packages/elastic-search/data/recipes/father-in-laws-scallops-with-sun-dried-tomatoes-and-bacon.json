    "summary": "My father-in-law made this for us on a visit, and we had to have the recipe. Sauteed scallops with sun-dried tomatoes, double-smoked bacon, garlic and a white wine cream sauce are served over angel hair pasta. This dish could be served in a fine restaurant and yet it is so simple and easy to prepare. Delicious!",
