    "summary": "Marinated and grilled chicken breast and a blend of Mexican cheese nachos topped with lime crema and cilantro. I created this dish to pair with Vermentino wine which is customarily served with seafood. The pair worked really well and I had many requests for the nacho recipe. I kind of just did it, so use this as a guideline and make it your own!",
