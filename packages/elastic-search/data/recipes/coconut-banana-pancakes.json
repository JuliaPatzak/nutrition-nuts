    "summary": "Easy and yummy! Banana pancakes from scratch, with the perfect coconut syrup. My family absolutely loves them! I usually have to triple the recipe! It took me forever to find a good banana pancake recipe I like. It took me even longer to find coconut syrup I liked. This syrup is great because it doesn't have any of the coconut shavings in it. So kids will like it!",
