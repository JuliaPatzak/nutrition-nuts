    "summary": "A healthy hummus, with a sushi-like twist! This is my first ever published recipe, so please be honest and kind in your comments! For my first batch I tried adding a sheet of nori (seaweed). I do not recommend this, unless you REALLY like the flavor of nori, as it completely overpowered the other flavors. Maybe some small slices on top, as a garnish?  I've found that this recipe makes a nice condiment on sandwiches, too!",
