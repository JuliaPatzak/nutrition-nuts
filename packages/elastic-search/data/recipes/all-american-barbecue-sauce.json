    "summary": "I'm very excited to show you my take on America's most popular style of barbecue sauce--which of course originated in and around Kansas City. After you make a batch of this and taste just how incredible it is, I don't think you'll ever buy that stuff from the store again. Sauce may be used right away, but for best results, wrap and refrigerate for a day or two before using to allow the flavors to develop.",
