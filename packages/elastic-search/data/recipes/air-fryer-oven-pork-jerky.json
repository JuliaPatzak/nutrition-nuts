    "summary": "I typically leave the jerky making to my husband but I got an air fryer oven and decided to try my hand at it. While it does take time, it doesn't take near as long as the dehydrator method he uses. This was so easy, full of flavor, stores well, and just overall impressive! This is the perfect snack for camping, hiking, fishing, hunting, or any outdoor activity.",
