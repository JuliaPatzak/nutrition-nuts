    "summary": "These homemade Pop-Tarts\u00ae include all the flavor of the original, but don't contain any of the stuff you can't pronounce on the back of the box! They freeze well and can be filled with anything. Try pumpkin butter, cinnamon sugar, Nutella\u00ae, or peanut butter and jelly! Homemade fruit preserves are delicious as well! Top with confectioners' sugar.",
