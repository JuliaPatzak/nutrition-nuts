    "summary": "Bye-bye, rubbery calamari! Frozen calamari rings are first soaked in milk to tenderize them, then coated with a mixture of corn flour and gluten-free all-purpose flour before deep frying. Simple, easy, and tasty! Good served with cocktail sauce, garlic mayonnaise, or other dipping sauces and lemon wedges. Regular all-purpose flour may be substituted if you don't need to make these gluten free.",
