    "summary": "My mom liked to make the Hamburger Helper\u00ae version of this recipe. When I moved to another state, I could not find it, so I came up with this. Memories of home. My hubby likes for me to spice this up sometimes, so I will use a 14-ounce can of tomatoes and green chiles in it or just use a Mexican-style cornbread mix sometimes.",
