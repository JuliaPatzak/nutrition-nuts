    "summary": "I only eat paleo these days and sometimes it's hard to find recipes that are fast and easy to make. One beautiful Arizona day, I realized I was really hungry, but was also totally unwilling to head to the store. So I scraped together what ingredients I had and was pretty pleased with the end result. This is the first recipe I've ever shared here, so I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did! Garnish with some Thai basil and avocado pieces (maybe even a little bacon) and enjoy the heck out of this thing!",
