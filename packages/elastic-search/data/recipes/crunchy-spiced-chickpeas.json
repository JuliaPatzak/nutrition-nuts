    "summary": "There's a Mexican joint Michele and I go to once in a while that serves a complimentary bowl of spicy, fried chickpeas when you sit down to eat. It's a very nice touch, and a periodic reminder of what a great, highly-addictive snack this is. As in, only make single batches at a time, because you will eat everything you make. Season with any combination of spices that you like.",
