    "summary": "I get more requests to make this burger. They are to-die-for-juicy, and the flavor can't be beat. The onions cook on the inside of the burger. No need for toppings on these delicious burgers. I freeze extra single burgers in a sandwich bag for a quick week night meal. Enjoy the juiciness.",
