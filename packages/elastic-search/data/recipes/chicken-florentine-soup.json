    "summary": "Soup is what happens when I have leftovers in the house and it's time to clear out the veggie drawer. I got the inspiration while lunching at the Palm Tree Grille in Mount Dora when attending the annual Plant and Garden Sale. I didn't have their soup but it was on special. This will be great for lunches during the week.",
