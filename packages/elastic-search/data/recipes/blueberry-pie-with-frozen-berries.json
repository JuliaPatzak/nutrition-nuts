        "5 cups frozen blueberries",
        "1 cup white sugar",
        "5 tablespoons cornstarch",
        "1 teaspoon lemon juice",
        "\u00bc teaspoon salt",
        "2\u2009\u00bc cups all-purpose flour",
        "\u00be cup salted butter",
        "\u00bd teaspoon salt",
        "6 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed",
        "1 tablespoon salted butter, cut into small pieces",
        "1 teaspoon salted butter, or as needed",
        "\u00bc cup milk"

    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Put frozen blueberries in a pot along with sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt",
        "Mix gently so that the blueberries will get covered with cornstarch; the cornstarch will help to thicken the pie filling",
        "Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally so it will not burn to the bottom, about 15 minutes",
        "While the pie filling is cooking, combine flour, 3/4 cup butter, and salt in a large mixing bowl",
        "Mix with a fork until crumbles form",
        "Slowly add cold water and mix until incorporated, adding more water as needed",
        "Divide dough into 2 equal pieces",
        "Shape each piece into a ball",
        "Roll out 1 dough ball with a rolling pin into a 10-inch circle",
        "Transfer pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish",
        "Trim the edge of the pie crust with scissors and crimp the rim with your fingertips and knuckles",
        "Remove pie filling from heat and pour into the pie crust",
        "Sprinkle 1 tablespoon butter pieces on top of the filling; the butter will melt and make a thin surface over the filling that will help you weave the strips of crust for the lattice on top",
        "Roll the top crust into a 10-inch circle",
        "Cut into 1/2-inch strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel",
        "Start with the longest strips and lay the first 2 in an X in the center of the pie",
        "Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern",
        "Use the shortest strips for the edges of the lattice",
        "Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and flute the crust",
        "Melt 1 teaspoon butter in milk by microwaving in a microwave-safe cup in 10-second intervals",
        "Brush over the top of the pie to get a nice golden brown crust",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes"
