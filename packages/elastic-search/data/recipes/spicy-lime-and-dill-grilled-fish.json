    "summary": "Super-fast entree that tastes like you spent time in the kitchen. Light, crisp flavors of lime and dill say 'summertime' even if you grill this in the winter! Don't like spicy food? No problem, just omit the red pepper flakes. Delicious with a side of grilled asparagus! Just pull the packets from the grill and serve. You can even eat out of packets for a hobo-style meal!",
