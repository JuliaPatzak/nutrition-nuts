    "summary": "Everyone who has tried this soup loves it. It is a good soup for veggie haters. Baking the potatoes first gives them the perfect texture for this thick creamy soup. You won't be disappointed. I always serve this with crackers and top the soup with a bit more shredded Cheddar, crumbled bacon, and a dollop of sour cream.",
