    "ingredients": [
        "1 large head cauliflower, cut into large chunks",
        "2\u2009\u00bd cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided",
        "\u00bd cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese",
        "1  egg",
        "\u00bc teaspoon salt",
        "\u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "\u00bc teaspoon garlic powder",
        "\u00bc teaspoon onion powder",
        "\u2153 cup pizza sauce"

    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Line a muffin tin with parchment paper squares",
        "Grate cauliflower into a microwave-safe bowl using a fine grater",
        "Chop up any remaining pieces that are too small to grate but too big for the crust",
        "Microwave cauliflower until soft and tender, 4 to 6 minutes",
        "Pour cauliflower into a clean dish towel cool easily handled, 15 to 20 minutes",
        "Wrap the towel around the cauliflower and squeeze out as much liquid as possible; the drier the cauliflower is, the better it will hold together as a crust once mixed with the other ingredients",
        "Combine cauliflower, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl",
        "Scoop cauliflower crust mixture into prepared muffin tin, dividing the mixture evenly among the cups",
        "Pat down cauliflower mixture with the back of a spoon, making it compact",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes",
        "Spoon a small amount of pizza sauce onto each cauliflower crust",
        "Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, dividing evenly among the crusts",
        "Bake until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes",
        "Let sit in pan for 5 minutes before moving each bite to a cooling rack",
        "Let cool for 10 minutes",
        "Peel parchment paper squares off the crusts and serve on a platter"
