    "summary": "I kinda winged this recipe but it turned out great! Authentic Creole flavors and so easy to make! I used pre-cooked/Cajun-seasoned shrimp which made this gumbo with okra that much easier, but you can just use raw shrimp. Adjust the spice to make it as hot or mild as you'd like. Leftovers freeze well. Serve with rice and/or crusty French bread!",
