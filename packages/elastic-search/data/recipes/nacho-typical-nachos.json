    "summary": "This is a recipe for a mixture you prepare and bake. Then serve with chips for dipping or as a filling for a tortilla shell. It is a little runny, but it makes it really good! This only makes enough for 3-4 people for a main dish for dinner. I would suggest doubling it if you have a larger group or hungry group of folks!",
