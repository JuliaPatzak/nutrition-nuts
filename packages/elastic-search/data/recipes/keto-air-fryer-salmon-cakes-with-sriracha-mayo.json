    "summary": "Salmon cakes can certainly be keto-friendly if you just tweak a few ingredients. They make a great dinner or you can serve atop a salad for a delicious lunch. The mixture can get a little sticky, so I spray my hands with cooking spray when handling, and I use a small silicone spatula to help get them off the plate and into the fryer.",
