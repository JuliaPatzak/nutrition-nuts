    "summary": "A Czech specialty.  Delicious and easy to make. If desired, you can frost or glaze these and top with slivered almonds or other nut meats. You can use apricot filling instead of the poppyseed filling and if you don't have the round pans you can bake the rings on regular cookie sheets (just be sure to place the seams of the rings are well sealed and placed downward on the sheets).",
