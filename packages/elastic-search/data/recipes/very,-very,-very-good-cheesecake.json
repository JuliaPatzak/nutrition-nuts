    "summary": "I first made this cheesecake for dinner guests about two years ago.  I haven't stopped getting requests for it since.  Though it's made with extremely rich ingredients, the cake turns out wonderfully light.  I never liked cheesecake much before I tried this recipe - but boy, have I been reformed!  It's quite easy to make too!",
