    "summary": "A delicious broth-based soup that can be modified to your taste! It's close to a Mushroom Soup that I had at a great deli in Florida--I've been trying to duplicate it ever since! I finally found a basic recipe that I was able to modify and this is the result. Great with salad or a sandwich. I hope that you enjoy it! Recommended mushrooms:  Shitake, Baby Portobellos & White/Button Mushrooms.",
