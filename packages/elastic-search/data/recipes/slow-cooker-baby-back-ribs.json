    "summary": "These are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! This is a very simple recipe that I came up with a few years ago. It's not rocket science, just ribs cooked in the slow cooker and finished in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week and have to work all day. I'm eating them within a half-hour of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!",
