    "summary": "I was looking for a good use of a ham bone without the heavy cream of a potato soup. I made use of a few other recipes to come up with one that I thought my husband and I would like. I think it is important to start with the three basics: onion, celery, and carrots. In addition, you can add a variety of different vegetables to suit your taste or depending on what you have in the house at the time.",
