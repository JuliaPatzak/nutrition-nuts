    "summary": "This is a wonderfully soothing and savory soup - a perfect choice for a holiday party or dinner. Adjust the amount of curry and soy sauce for spiciness. Adjust the amount of half-and-half, or substitute heavy cream or milk for varying levels of creaminess. Also, you can add sauteed chopped sweet onions with the first three ingredients (this works best with a creamier version).",
