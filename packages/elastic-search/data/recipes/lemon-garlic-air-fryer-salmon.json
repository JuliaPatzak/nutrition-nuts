    "summary": "This buttery lemon-garlic salmon is easy to throw together with a few simple ingredients. For best results, use center-cut fillets that are about 1-inch thick. Eight minutes cook time will produce salmon that is medium-well. Add 1 to 2 more minutes for well done, but take care not to overcook. Cook time may vary with different model air fryers.",
