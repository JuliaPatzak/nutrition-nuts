    "summary": "I make this salad all year long, but it is especially great for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Just freeze a few bags of cranberries to use at a later date. I know this will become a tradition to anyone who tries it, it's delicious! Garnish with frosted cranberries and mint leaves, if desired. For frosted cranberries, wet cranberries with water, and roll in sugar.",
