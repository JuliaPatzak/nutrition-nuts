    "summary": "I made this with what was harvested from my garden at the end of summer. A great representation of the bounty of summer and the joy of having my own vegetable garden. I added the shrimp for protein but this would be good on its own. The balsamic vinegar really helps cut the bitter taste of the greens. Serve hot with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.",
