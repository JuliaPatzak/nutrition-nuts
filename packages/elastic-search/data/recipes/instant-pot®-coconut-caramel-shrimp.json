    "summary": "I'm fortunate to live in Oklahoma where we have a lovely Vietnamese community. This is my Americanized version of coconut-caramel shrimp. It's made in an Instant Pot\u00ae, and while it can be made on the stovetop you'll use more pots and pans. I love serving this with jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk.",
