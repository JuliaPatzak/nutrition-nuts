    "summary": "This is a well loved recipe! I have an old, small crumpled piece of paper with this recipe hand written out from some years ago, not sure where it came from! I have my own scribbles and scratches on it, so I must have changed it somewhere in time, but this is how I have been making it the last 10 years. It is our favorite pancake recipe. So light, a little tangy, and very satisfying. Perfect with some fresh blueberries or strawberries.",
