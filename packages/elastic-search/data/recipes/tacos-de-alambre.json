    "summary": "This mild, authentic recipe for beef taco topping is an adaptation of a favorite recipe from a local restaurant in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The steak you use may vary according to what's available and cost-effective at your local grocery. We divide this dish into several meals by refrigerating the beef and vegetable mixture and cooking the bacon fresh each time.",
