    "summary": "Beets are an incredible vegetable. They're packed with tons of vitamins and antioxidants, and the dark crimson color adds a nice accent to most dishes. In this particular salad, they blend perfectly with the creamy feta cheese while balancing out the tang of kalamata olives. You'll convert even the most skeptical eaters who have always turned a nose to the wonderful world of beets with this salad topped with a citrus dressing over a bed of nutty arugula.",
