    "summary": "Fantastic bars that have a lot of flexibility.  You can adapt the recipe to your liking.  Great for hikes, long road trips and camping as they store well and keep fairly long -  unless you eat them all! Use any combination of chocolate chips, dried fruit, coconut, pecans, almond slices, or any other tidbits you'd like in a granola bar.",
