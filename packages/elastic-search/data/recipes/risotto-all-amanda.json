    "summary": "Proper risotto in the Italian-style can take a really long time to make. Here's a clever shortcut to truly stellar risotto; use a pressure cooker! This is the best risotto I've ever tasted, and it was improvised by my wife Amanda from scratch. I forced her to write down the recipe. And here it is, so the entire world can enjoy the sheer brilliance of great risotto in a fraction of the normal time. Don't say I never told you how awesome this stuff is.",
