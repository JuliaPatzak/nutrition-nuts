    "directions": [
        "Place the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, cumin, and chili paste in a large, heavy plastic zipper bag",

        "Allow to marinate for 30 to 45 minutes",
        "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate",
        "Remove the pork chops from the marinade, and discard the marinade",
