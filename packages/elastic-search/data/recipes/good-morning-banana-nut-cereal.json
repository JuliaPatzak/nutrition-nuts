    "summary": "This hot cereal is a delicious twist on oatmeal with some added protein and fiber to help satisfy you and keep you full.  It's a great start for a good morning!  Sometimes I heat up the water and milk real quick and let the quinoa soak while I'm in the shower, that way it can cook while I get ready and only needs a couple more minutes once everything else is added. Top with granola, if desired. Apple slices and/or sauce can be substituted for banana.",
