    "summary": "This is my first attempt at making caldo de pollo. I think it turned out great. You might need to add salt to taste as my recipe doesn't have very much. I like to serve this with warm corn tortillas and a side of Spanish rice and refried beans. Please enjoy and let me know what you think.",
