    "summary": "Chaat is a broad term that encompasses many different dishes. This recipe is made of yogurt and potatoes and other chaat sauces. You may need to make a trip to an Indian grocery store to stock up on spherical 'puris' (also called as pani-puri puris), 'sev', green chutney, and a sweet and sour chutney. I have tried here to give as many substitutions as possible, if you are unable to go to an Indian grocery store. However, you will definitely lose the authentic taste if you make substitutions. If you can find them, use black salt in place of the rock salt, spherical puris in place of the wheat crackers, and plain sev in place of the crushed potato chips.",
