    "ingredients": [
        "1 (3 pound) whole filet of salmon, skin on, scored (up to but not through the skin)  into serving pieces",
        "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
        "4 large garlic cloves, minced",
        "\u00bc cup minced fresh dill",
        "2 teaspoons salt",
        "1 teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for serving"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Soak an untreated cedar plank (or planks) large enough to hold a side of salmon (5 to 7 inches wide and 16 to 20 inches long) in water, weighting it with something heavy, like a brick, so it stays submerged 30 minutes to 24 hours",
        "When ready to grill, either build a charcoal fire in half the grill or turn grill burners on high for 10 minutes",
        "Meanwhile, mix oil, garlic, dill, salt, pepper and lemon zest; rub over salmon and into scored areas to coat",
        "Place soaked cedar on hot grill grate, close lid, and watch until wood starts to smoke, about 5 minutes",
        "Transfer salmon to hot plank, move salmon off direct charcoal heat or turn burners to low, and cook covered until salmon is just opaque throughout (130 on a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section) 20 to 25 minutes or longer, depending on thickness and grill temperature",
        "Let sit 5 minutes; serve with lemon wedges"
