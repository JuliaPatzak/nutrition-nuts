    "summary": "The easiest, quickest, most delicious salsa. Good with chips, with ceviche, on tacos. It fits into most diets, in particular keto, just be careful as mango is high in carbs and sugars! Make sure you go wash your hands in hot soapy water after cutting the habaneros for at least 20 seconds, because, melting your face off sucks. Seriously - the oil stays on for a long time.",
