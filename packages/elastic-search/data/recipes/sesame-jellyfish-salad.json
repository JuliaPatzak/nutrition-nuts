    "summary": "I learned to love sesame-flavoured jellyfish from having it at Chinese banquets growing up. Now I make this variation of jellyfish salad with chopped or grated veggies and a spicy sesame sauce. This makes a refreshing and delicious side dish or Chinese-style shared dish. Jellyfish is flavourless, but it is delightfully crunchy and lends itself to various flavour combinations. Serve chilled or at room temperature.",
