    "summary": "A new fall favorite in our house, adapted from both an oat scone recipe and one for pumpkin scones similar to that from a well-known coffee shop. I'm not sure if quick-cooking oats would work; try them at your own risk! If you have Penzeys\u00ae Baking Spice, I like to add 1 teaspoon of that and also use a pinch in the icing.",
