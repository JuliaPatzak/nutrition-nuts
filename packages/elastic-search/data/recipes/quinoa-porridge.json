    "summary": "Looking for ideas for the quinoa you picked up at Trader Joe's?  Here's a dairy and wheat free breakfast porridge thick, rich and delish for those cold mornings in the Andes.  Those with nut allergies may wish to substitute soymilk or regular cow's milk for the almond.  Adjust sugar to your taste or substitute with agave syrup or black strap molasses (use half as much). This recipe can easily be doubled.",
