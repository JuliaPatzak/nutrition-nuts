    "summary": "This sauce is so amazing. I was trying to think of a good sauce without having too much of a tomato taste, and this does it. The mixture of veggies and seasonings does it. To make this more spicy, you can add fresh chiles or hot red peppers crushed. I don't like really hot food, so this was perfect for us. The vinegar makes it have a bit of a bite to it. You can add a bit more or less depending on your taste. Boil 2 pounds noodles; when done, pour sauce over noodles on your plate.",
