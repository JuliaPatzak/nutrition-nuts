    "summary": "Quick and easy dinner.  A family favorite. This was my mother's recipe.  In my humble opinion she was the best cook ever.  This recipe is very versatile and can be seasoned so many different ways.  Please feel free to try your own favorite seasoning combinations.  My two boys who are now 27 and 31 and my husband  request this simple dinner frequently and I have taught the boys to make it but they say mine tastes different.  I love to cook and they love to eat.  This is such a simple recipe and I usually double so they have plenty to take home with them.  It heats up well.",
