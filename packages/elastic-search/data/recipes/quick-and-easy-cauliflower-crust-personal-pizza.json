    "summary": "A convenient, quick, low-cost way to whip up a yummy cauliflower pizza (or flatbread) for one. Buy inexpensive frozen cauliflower when on sale and thaw as needed to make a single crust. Uses just a few ingredients I always have on hand. The seeds are carried in the health section of grocery stores, even in my small town. You could leave them out, but I recommend them for added nutrition-especially  iron, fiber, and protein.",
