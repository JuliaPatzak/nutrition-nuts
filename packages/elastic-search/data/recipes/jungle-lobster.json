    "summary": "This is something I came up with while staying at a guest house at the Jungle Place located south of Playa del Carmen, Mexico. You can squeeze either a little fresh lime juice or lemon juice on top.  A very easy side is a half avocado sliced and arranged in fan style, drizzled with olive oil, lemon, oregano, salt and pepper.",
