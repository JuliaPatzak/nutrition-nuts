    "summary": "This a casserole-type shrimp and grits, which is how it is served at my favorite restaurant, where the shrimp and grits are served in an individual stoneware dish, topped with cheese, and baked until melted and crusty. The cheese grits are a variation of a recipe of a good friend, which are so scrumptious it will make you beg and howl for more! This recipe would be just as good using white cheddar.",
