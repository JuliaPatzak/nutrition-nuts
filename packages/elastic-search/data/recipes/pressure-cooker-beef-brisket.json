    "summary": "This is my go-to recipe for brisket. I usually use bison brisket, but beef brisket works as well. This recipe is easy to prepare and using the pressure cooker greatly reduces cooking time as compared to other methods. The brisket comes out moist, tender, and flavorful, and the gravy is also excellent. I have used this recipe for briskets as large as 6 pounds with equal success, but increased the cook time to 55 minutes. I use an electric pressure cooker for this recipe, but it can also be made in a pressure cooker on the stove. The rub step can be skipped.",
