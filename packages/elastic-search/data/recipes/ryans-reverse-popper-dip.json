    "summary": "Before my son left for boot camp, I wanted to give him a going away party complete with all of his favorite foods. There wasn't enough time to stuff and wrap jalapenos for poppers so I took his favorite recipe and turned it into a warm spicy dip that disappeared faster than any poppers I've ever made! Serve warm with your favorite chips.",
