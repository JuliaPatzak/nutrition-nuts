    "summary": "A supremely filling, hearty soup.  I serve this on cold rainy days with a loaf of homemade bread.  Hint: this is perfect for leftover rotisserie chicken or chicken you've pulled from the bone after making homemade chicken stock!  This soup makes great leftovers, but you might want to thin it slightly with skim milk or water when reheating.",
