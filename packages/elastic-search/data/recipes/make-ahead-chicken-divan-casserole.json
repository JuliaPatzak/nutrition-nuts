    "summary": "My entire family loves this dish. The word \u201ccasserole\u201d is in the name since traditional chicken divan is made separate from the rice and served alongside it. This can be prepared a day or two in advance and baked before serving. Simplify the process by using leftover cooked rice and a store-bought cooked chicken.",
