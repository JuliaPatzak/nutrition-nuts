    "summary": "A yummy dessert to serve at your Seder meal, or anytime. Nice and sweet and has the option to be topped with a frosting for those like me with a sweet tooth, or served plain for those without the sweet tooth. You can also change the nuts or type of chips you use to change the flavor. Even mix in dried fruits. Options are limitless! Under-bake slightly to keep them chewy.",
