    "summary": "Beautiful, in-season apricots were my inspiration for this coffee cake. I created it for a get-together with friends for our annual porch party. Because it was an evening event, it became a dessert. Great on its own for a morning coffee cake or served in the evening as a dessert topped with vanilla bean ice cream.",
