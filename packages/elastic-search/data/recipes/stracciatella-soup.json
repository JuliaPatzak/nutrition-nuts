    "summary": "Stracciatella is often referred to as 'Italian egg drop soup,' which is fine, but knowing the name actually means little, torn rags or shreds works so much better metaphorically.\u00a0When you've been run ragged, stracciatella is always there for you.\u00a0As you eat this, hopefully with some nice crusty bread, imagine all those little 'rags' floating in the bowl are all your torn-up problems, both real and imagined.\u00a0They were there, and then they were gone. You just won--with soup.",
