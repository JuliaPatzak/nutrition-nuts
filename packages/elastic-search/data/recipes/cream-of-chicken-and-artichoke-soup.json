    "summary": "After dining at a certain restaurant that is known for making cheesecake, I fell in love with their chicken and artichoke soup. I've looked through various websites in search of a similar recipe. I couldn't find a recipe for it, but did find one that has some of the same type of ingredients so I tweaked it by adding some vegetables and putting a twist on it. Here is what I came up with. This is a pretty easy recipe and tastes very good. Top with shredded cheese.",
