    "summary": "This is one of my favorite friday night dishes. This pizza is quick, simple and delicious. Instead of making the pizza dough from scratch I decided to use naan bread for the pizza base. Using naan bread not only saves time but it is great for portion control. The only difference between this recipe and most pizza recipes is that It doesn't include a tomato sauce on the base. I don't like the sogginess that comes from the sauce, but feel free to try it with the sauce as it will still yield good results.",
