    "summary": "This is not a quick recipe, but the results are worth it. I usually take an entire Saturday to make this, but most of the time it's simmering on the stove, so it's not labor intensive. Chicken bones browned with celery, onions and carrots make this broth dark and rich. I freeze leftover rotisserie chicken bones and make this about once a month or so. I freeze the stock in quart bags and use one whenever I would use chicken broth.",
