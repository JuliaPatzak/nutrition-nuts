    "summary": "Dry sauce mix combines with asparagus and salmon to make a dish that will impress your friends--and you don't have to tell them how easy it is! Mezzi rigatoni is my favorite kind of pasta to use with this one, but ziti, penne, and other hearty pasta cuts will work just as well. Serve with Parmesan cheese.",
