    "summary": "This isn't authentic sushi by any means, but it really does mimic the flavor of those popular sushi rolls you can find at less \"fine dining\" sushi restaurants--and it's very family-friendly and home chef-friendly as well. Great to cut into sushi-portioned appetizers and serve with traditional pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.",
