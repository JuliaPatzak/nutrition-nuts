    "summary": "This dip was the result of endless combinations to try to come up with some dip that I didn't have to cook for work. Serve immediately or it is even better if you leave it in the refrigerator overnight. Store in nonmetallic air-tight container. The only kitchen utensil you need is a food processor. Best with pita chips, crostini, or some kind of chip with less salt.",
