    "summary": "A staple for me in college, this is a sweet, salty, nutty dish that can be cooked up in less than 15 minutes.  Measurements for the sauce can be adjusted for your taste, but with these ingredients, you can't go wrong!  I use pre-washed, pre-cut broccoli florets to cut down on prep time as well.",
