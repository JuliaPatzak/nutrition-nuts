    "summary": "I eat this quite a bit at our local Chinese restaurants, so I recreated it at home and made it even tastier. These are time-consuming, and I recommend using oil in the deep fryer that is ready to change as the marinade will ruin it for cooking anything else. I've also done this technique successfully with squid. I've also added in very thinly sliced onion and green peppers to the marinade and it was really good.",
