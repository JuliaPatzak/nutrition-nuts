    "summary": "Flavored with rosemary, ancho, and molasses, these chicken wings honor this year's Super Bowl\u00ae teams, one being the Los Angeles Rams and the other which shall not be named. You'll use the easiest of methods to produce the most crowd-pleasing, finger-messing 'sticky wings.' The technique simply involves soaking wings in a sweet, spicy marinade, baking them wet, and then tossing them with a finishing glaze.",
