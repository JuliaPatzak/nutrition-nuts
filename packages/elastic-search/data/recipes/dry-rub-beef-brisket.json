    "summary": "Spicy and smoky beef brisket. My version has no BBQ sauce added. Keep the dish tightly covered during cooking and don't peek. This prevents the brisket from drying out. If you use a larger or smaller brisket, adjust the cooking time to 1 hour per pound. Cut the brisket against the grain with a sharp knife, or it will be stringy.",
