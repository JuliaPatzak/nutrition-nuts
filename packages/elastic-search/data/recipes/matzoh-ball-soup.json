    "summary": "This is one of my favorite soup recipes.  I always double the recipe for the matzoh balls, since everyone enjoys them so well.  You may wish to cook the matzo balls in slightly salted  water, allow them to cool for several minutes in the water after they're cooked,  then transfer them to the soup.  Some people say that the matzoh balls make the broth a tad cloudy.",
