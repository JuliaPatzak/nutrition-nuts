    "summary": "This is my personal recipe, and it has won over 12 chili cook-offs, and I figured I'd share. It is a medium steak and bean chili. If I had to compare it, it would be similar to Steak N' Shake's chili, but better! It's rather involved, but trust me. Worth every minute! Try it. You will not be disappointed!",
