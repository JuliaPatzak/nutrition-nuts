    "summary": "This appetizer features pan-fried wontons stuffed with lamb and green peas. The mint in the dipping sauce perfectly complements the fatty, gamey flavor of the lamb. If you don't love lamb, this is really just a technique-you can stuff these with any kind of meat and vegetables you like.",
