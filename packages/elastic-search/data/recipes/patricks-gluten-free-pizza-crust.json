    "summary": "After about 3 years of experimentation and countless pizza dough recipes and big-name dough mixes, this is the closest I have come to real pizza dough. This recipe will yield two 16-inch pizzas. Remove baked crusts from the oven and top as desired; place back in the oven for approximately 15 minutes. I did not include the ingredients for the toppings as that is very subjective based on your preferences.",
