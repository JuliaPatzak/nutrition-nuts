    "summary": "Great crusty bread requires a great deal of time to make, patience, and the perfect environment. The Instant Pot\u00ae cuts the time by several hours and creates the perfect slightly moist, warm environment perfect for activating dough. This goes so great with a good slathering of butter or dipped in a warm bowl of stew!",
