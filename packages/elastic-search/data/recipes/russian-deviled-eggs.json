    "summary": "I am calling these Russian because of my use of beets in the recipe. One day when I decided to make deviled eggs for the first time, I had made a beet salad that my mom taught me. This was just grated boiled beets mixed with mayonnaise and fresh garlic. I decided to use this instead of just plain mayo. And from here, my recipe was born! Hope you like it.",
