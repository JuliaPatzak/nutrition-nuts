    "summary": "A clam chowder soup to be enjoyed.  Uncle Bill's Tips:  Fresh baby clams can be used instead of canned clams.  In order to do this you will need 4 pounds of baby clams in the shell.  First, steam clams in 2 1/2 cups water until they open. (Discard any clams that don't open.)  Save the liquid and pour through a very fine sieve to remove any particles.  Extract clams from the shell and add to soup; as directed in the recipe.  You can also use the left over liquid in place of clam juice.",
