    "summary": "I've made Cajun boiled peanuts many times over the years but was wanting to do something different this time. While trying to come up with something, I looked over and saw a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips and thought... why not? Making boiled peanuts in the Instant Pot\u00ae is as easy as 1-2-3. Pour them in and walk away. No more babysitting the pot of boiling water on the stove.",
