    "summary": "Tangy and sweet old-fashioned baked beans with a little jalapeno. They're easy to make and great at a BBQ, hamburger night, a picnic, etc. My husband's favorite semi-homemade recipe. Says the sweetness and fire create a super depth of flavor. It's not strong enough to overwhelm the sweet home-style of baked beans.",
