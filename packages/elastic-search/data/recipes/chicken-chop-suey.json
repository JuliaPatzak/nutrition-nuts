    "summary": "Chop suey has always been my favorite dish at Chinese restaurants, and after several tries I've managed to come up with this dish that tastes very similar to the chop suey at my favorite Chinese restaurant. There is a lot of chopping, but it's well worth the effort. The prep time depends on how quickly you can chop. We like it with vegetable fried rice or honey-garlic spare ribs.",
