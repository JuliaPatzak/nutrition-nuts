    "summary": "This is the classic and authentic Italian minestrone with a green twist. No tomatoes here! You may brown some pancetta or bacon in olive oil before proceeding with the recipe if you wish. I prefer to use a good quality vegetable bouillon to vegetable broth. The taste is more authentic and you simply need to skip the salt.",
