    "summary": "There are few things as easy, healthy, and delicious as this ubiquitous dip. However, unless you're grinding your aromatic vegetation in a\u00a0molcajete,\u00a0or against a cutting board, you're really not tasting a classic guacamole.\u00a0The flavors not only become more intense, but actually change in character. This is just what those bland, fatty, but delectable avocados need. That and a thoughtful seasoning of lime juice, and maybe some more salt.",
