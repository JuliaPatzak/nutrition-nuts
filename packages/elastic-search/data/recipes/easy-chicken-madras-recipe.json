    "summary": "Takeaways: the great British institution. We love them. In fact, all of us, on average, have 2 takeaways a week. I love them, too. They're delicious, but should be an occasional treat. I love Indian food and I discovered Madras whilst at an Indian restaurant. It comes from a region known as Madras in southern India, which is now modern-day Chennai. This is a perfect swap - with fewer calories! Serve with a big spoonful of basmati rice, yogurt, and a fluffy naan.",
