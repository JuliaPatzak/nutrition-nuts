    "summary": "This is a recipe I made by taking the best of three or four popper recipes and combining them to make something that tastes wonderful. A frequent request at my house, and at others.  I usually make 100 and put them in the fridge.  They don't last long. Adjust the amount of bacon bits and type of shredded cheese to taste. Increase the recipe as necessary!  Lots of tests helps to best figure out the way you like it. Be sure to wear rubber gloves while seeding the jalapenos -- they will burn.",
