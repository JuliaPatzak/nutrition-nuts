    "summary": "I created this soup after becoming tired of the excess salt and lack of veggies in canned minestrone.  I recalled a great bowl of minestrone that was overflowing with rich vegetables at the 'Sheepherder's Inn' in Sacramento, California.  Great with a hearty bread, romaine salad and a nice Merlot!",
