    "summary": "Similar to the more well known version made with chicken livers, but I've made some additions. This came about when a co-worker gave me about a dozen duck breasts and I had to find a way to use them up. The result was an appetizer that continues to be a favorite at dinner parties, and one that can be prepared well in advance of actual cooking. If you are like some people who don't care for the gamey flavor of wild duck, I'm including a technique to soften or tame it. This can be made the day before your party and kept tightly covered in the fridge. Bring to room temperature before the final grilling.",
