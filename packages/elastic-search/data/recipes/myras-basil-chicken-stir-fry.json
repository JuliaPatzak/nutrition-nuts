    "summary": "This is easy and my kids love it. I've also made it with cubed pork from cheap pork chops. You can spice this dish up with crushed red pepper flakes. Serve over rice. Don't substitute dried basil, though! It has to be fresh! And though it sounds like a lot of basil, that makes the dish.",
