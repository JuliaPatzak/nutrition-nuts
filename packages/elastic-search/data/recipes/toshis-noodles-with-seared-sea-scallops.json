    "summary": "This is one of my mom's favorite noodle dishes! I've spiced it up a bit with more chili crisp than she would normally use, but it's worth it! The thin spaghetti noodles get an Asian flare, and the mini scallops add a wonderful but subtle seafood flavor. The broccoli is cooked perfectly since it is steamed first.",
