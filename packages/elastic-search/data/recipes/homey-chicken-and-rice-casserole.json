    "summary": "This tasty and comforting dish is a cinch to throw together, and you'd never suspect that the creaminess comes from reduced-fat ingredients. It lends itself to substitution, so if you're not a fan of certain tastes, you can easily switch to another variety of cream soup and/or use other veggies. I recommend using rotisserie chicken for added convenience.",
