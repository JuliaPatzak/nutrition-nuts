    "summary": "These grilled carrots have a lovely sweet and smoky caramelized flavor, and are a nice change of pace at a summer cookout or dinner party. Use carrots that are no larger than 3/4-inch thick, or cut larger carrots in half lengthwise for even cooking. One pound should yield 6 to 8 medium carrots.",
