    "summary": "When I found one lone russet potato at the bottom of the bin, I decided to make a small batch of gnocchi--the perfect thing to do with one potato. I like a very potato-y gnocchi, so I go with just enough flour to form the dough. Other people prefer a denser, more pasta-like dumpling, and use much more flour. I know many of you hate it when I say this, but you'll just have to figure it out as you go.",
