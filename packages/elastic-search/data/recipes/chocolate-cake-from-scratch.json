    "summary": "Excellent chocolate cake from scratch with a twist. The coffee adds an extra dimension to the flavor. This has been everyone's favorite for years. A great recipe when paired with a cream cheese frosting. Very moist and enjoyable. You won't go back to a boxed cake again. Also makes great cupcakes.",
