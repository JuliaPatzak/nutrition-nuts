    "summary": "Not only will I show you an easy and delicious way to make salmon, I'm going to show you what I think is a very clever technique for turning the least desirable cut of salmon into something absolutely fabulous. Basically, this is one of those \"when life gives you lemons\" lessons. Serve on top of a shaved cucumber salad and sprinkle with more cayenne pepper if you like.",

    "directions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)",
        "Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease with 1 teaspoon olive oil",
        "Place salmon tail skin-side down onto a paper towel",
        "Place a knife at the point of the tail; use a sawing motion to carefully cut the salmon away from the skin",
        "Trim off any connective tissue",
        "Cut salmon in half lengthwise into 2 equal pieces",
        "Cut each piece lengthwise into 3 long strips",
        "Place 1 strip of salmon on the prepared baking sheet",
        "Wind the strip into a spiral, with the thickest part in the center",
        "Overlap the thin end of a second strip over the first; wrap around the spiral",
        "Position the third strip in a way that maintains the circular shape",
        "Repeat with the other 3 strips to form the second medallion",
        "Fold a 15x4-inch piece of aluminum foil a few times to make a long strip about 1 1/2-inches wide",
        "Rub the foil with the remaining oil and wrap it around the outside edges of a salmon medallion, creating a collar",
        "Pinch foil together and make sure salmon is as round and uniformly thick as possible",
        "Repeat with the second medallion",
