    "summary": "Since the Covid lockdown, I haven't been able to go to IKEA\u00ae where they serve delicious veggie balls. So in the true self-assemble spirit that makes it so famous, I set out to make a clone. Mine are even better. The original has pea protein and kale, which I find expensive and gross, respectively. I made some changes to make it easier on the wallet and taste buds, then bake them. Some assembly required. Serve bowl-style with rice and your favorite sauce.",
