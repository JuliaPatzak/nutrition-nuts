    "summary": "I have been using this method for years and always have perfect results for making pulled pork. This will give you tender, juicy, fall-apart meat. This method works equally as well on smaller or bigger pork butts. The final internal temperature of the meat is what's important. Smoking meat is an all-day affair, but well worth the time investment! I like to use a variety of wood chips, including maple, apple and bourbon barrel. Serve with your favorite sauce.",
