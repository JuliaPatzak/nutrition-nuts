    "summary": "My husband's aunt passed along this super-easy recipe for this Hungarian sweet bread, and I made a couple of revisions to my family's taste.  Cinnamon, poppy seed, or walnuts are a traditional filling.  Her recipe is for cinnamon, but one of my favorite ways is to break from tradition and use a cocoa/sugar/butter/vanilla mixture.  It's delicious, especially when the leftovers are toasted and buttered!",
