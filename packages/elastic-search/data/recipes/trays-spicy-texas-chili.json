    "summary": "Being in Texas, chili is a staple on the few cold days we have each year. This is something I've come up with after years of trying to perfect an easy-to-make and delicious chili. This is a very spicy chili and the perfect meal for a chilly day. The beans are optional here as they traditionally aren't found in Texas chili.",
