    "summary": "This recipe combines spicy, sweet, and salty with a definite Caribbean flair. The multigrain chips make it a heartier and healthier dish, and add a wonderful nutty flavor. Chicken can be subbed for the shrimp, but increase the cooking time as necessary. Serve with sour cream and picante salsa.",
