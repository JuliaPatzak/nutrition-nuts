    "summary": "My kids love the taquitos we get at the grocery store in the freezer aisle. They would happily eat them every day. However, the mean mommy that I am, am working on reducing the amount of processed food in our diet so I had to try homemade. After checking all the recipes for taquitos I could find, I decided to mix it up and create my own! So I took ideas from about 4 different recipes and went to town. My kids and husband have given their seal of approval. My very picky 3-year-old even had seconds! I serve them on a bed of lettuce with sour cream and do Mexican rice on the side.",
