    "summary": "Simple, tasty peanut butter cookies packed with protein. So full of peanut butter flavor, they will practically melt in your mouth! These cookies will not turn out cake-like due to the whey protein. As a matter of fact, many of the people I serve these to either can't tell the difference, or prefer these over other versions of peanut butter cookies!",
