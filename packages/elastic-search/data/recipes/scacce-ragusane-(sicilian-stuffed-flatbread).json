    "summary": "This is my first attempt ever at this incredibly unique and delicious Sicilian stuffed flatbread. What we have here is a very familiar pizza-like flavor profile, but the delivery system is unlike anything you've ever experienced. The outside edges are crispy and crunchy while that saucy and cheesy center is much like a pasta in texture. So, while this is vaguely similar to a lot of things, it's really unlike anything else.",

    "ingredients": [
        "\u2153 cup warm water, or more as needed",
        "1 teaspoon active dry yeast",
        "1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons olive oil",
        "1\u2009\u00be cups semolina flour",
        "1\u2009\u00bc teaspoons kosher salt",
        "1 tablespoon cornmeal, or as needed",
        "\u00bd cup prepared pizza sauce",
        "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, or to taste",
        "6 ounces aged provolone cheese, sliced"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Pour 1/3 cup warm water into a mixing bowl and sprinkle yeast over the top",
        "Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure yeast is active",
        "Add olive oil, semolina flour, and salt to the yeast mixture",
        "Mix with your hand to form a relatively stiff ball of dough, adding more water if needed to bring the dough together",
        "Transfer dough to a work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes",
        "Cover with the mixing bowl and let rest for 30 minutes",
        "Uncover and knead the dough for another 3 or 4 minutes; divide dough into 2 portions, and shape each into smooth balls",
        "Use damp hands to help smooth the dough out, if needed",
        "Generously dust half of a kitchen towel with semolina flour and place the 2 balls of dough on top",
        "Sprinkle more flour on top of the balls and cover with the other half of the towel",
        "Leave to rise until the dough has almost doubled in size, about 2 hours",
        "Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C)",
        "Line a baking sheet with foil and sprinkle with cornmeal",
        "Roll each ball of dough out into a very thin circle or oval shape on a lightly floured surface",
        "Combine pizza sauce and basil in a bowl",
        "Spread with a thin layer of sauce and scatter pieces of provolone cheese every few inches, leaving a 1 inch border",
        "Fold over the opposite edges toward the middle to form a rectangle",
        "Press lightly to flatten slightly",
        "Repeat sauce and cheese step",
        "Fold each end toward the center to make a square shape",
        "Spread with a thin layer of sauce and scatter pieces of cheese on just one half",
        "Fold in half, overlapping the edge by about 1 inch",
        "Transfer to the prepared baking sheet",
        "Repeat filling and folding the second piece of dough",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until very well browned, 16 to 18 minutes",
        "Some spots may get charred, but this is fine and desirable, since scacce are traditionally cooked in very hot wood-fired ovens",
        "Let rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving"
