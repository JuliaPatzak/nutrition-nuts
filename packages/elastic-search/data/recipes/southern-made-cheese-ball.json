    "summary": "This delicious cheese ball was developed and modified by me, and every time I serve it I am forced to share the recipe with everyone who tastes it. I roll mine in diced green onion, pecans (or other nuts) or bacon bits before serving. Try experimenting with different types of meats and cheeses. It's a great appetizer for any party. This one will be gone first. Enjoy!",
