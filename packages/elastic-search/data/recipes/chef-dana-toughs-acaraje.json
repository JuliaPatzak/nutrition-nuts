    "summary": "These African-inspired fritters are made with dried beans that are fermented. The batter is whipped just before frying to create a delicate, fluffy interior. This distant relative of falafel is served with savory yogurt and harissa sauce, making for a dipping sauce that's both fiery and cooling. Acaraj\u00e9 makes for a great meatless protein on a salad but can also be enjoyed on its own as an appetizer.",
