    "summary": "This has been a family favorite for years. The key to this recipe is not overcooking the carrots and allowing the entire salad to marinate for at least 12 hours. For a spectacular presentation when serving, garnish the top with rings of each color of bell pepper and rings of onion.  Serve alone or over a bed of lettuce.",
