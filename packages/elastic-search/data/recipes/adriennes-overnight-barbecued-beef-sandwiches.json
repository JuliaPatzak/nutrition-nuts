    "summary": "Growing up, my Mom used to make barbecued beef in the crock pot and it always tasted so good.  It's definitely comfort food for me. After I got out on my own, I was determined to make barbecue beef just like hers, so I tried lots of recipes and finally came up with one of my own. I was so pleased! I called her to tell her and she laughed. She had always just used a bottle of barbecue sauce! We still laugh about that and now I've had to give her my recipe!",
