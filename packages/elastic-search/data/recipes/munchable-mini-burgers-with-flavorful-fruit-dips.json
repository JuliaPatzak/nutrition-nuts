    "summary": "These adorable mini-burgers are infused with all the nutrition of pureed sweet potatoes--a rich source of vitamin A.  This canned vegetable gives the burgers a soft, creamy consistency that little children love. And the natural sugar in the sweet potatoes helps make the patties brown beautifully in seconds.  Serve them on fresh-baked biscuits (or by their lonesome) with one or more of the delicious fruit dips that follow.  Each dip recipe makes enough for a whole batch of burgers.",
