    "summary": "We're making dumplings without wrappers, which is why I'm calling these naked. I thought the slightly provocative name would work well as an appetizer for your Valentine's Day menu--if you stay home and cook something from scratch, you increase your chances of getting lots of compliments. You can enjoy the dashi with so many things like eggs, fried tofu, or ramen noodles, just to name a few. Garnish with sliced green onions, thinly sliced red chiles, and toasted sesame seeds.",
