    "summary": "This cheese dip is easily the best that I've ever had, and being a college student I've had quite a lot. The only reason there are ever leftovers is because this dip is so delicious and filling. I recommend Mission\u00ae or On The Border\u00ae chips because this dip is rather thick and you need a durable chip that wont break off too easy!",
