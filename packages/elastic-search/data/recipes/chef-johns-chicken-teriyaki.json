    "summary": "I have enjoyed teriyaki many times at Japanese restaurants. If I've made it at home I've probably just bought a bottle of teriyaki sauce and brushed it on some chicken. This is an authentic version. I'm very glad I did it. The term teriyaki comes from of two Japanese words \u2018teri' and \u2018yaki'. Teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce, and yaki means to broil or grill the meat.",
