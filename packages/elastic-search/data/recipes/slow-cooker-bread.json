    "summary": "Bread made in the slow cooker actually turns out a decent loaf, and it's very easy because this is a no-knead recipe. It is also quick because it requires only one rise; the second rise happens in the slow cooker.\u00a0Adding seeds or rolled oats not only adds flavor, it also makes it easier to release the bread from the slow cooker.",

    "directions": [
        "Stir 1 cup water and yeast together in a small bowl until yeast is dissolved",
        "Let sit until frothy or foamy, about 10 minutes",
        "Mix flour and salt together in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid",
        "Add yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until evenly combined and no traces of flour remain",
        "Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and stir again; dough should be tacky but not wet",
        "Cover container with the lid",
        "Let dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour",
        "Set slow cooker to High",
        "Cut a piece of parchment paper to line the bottom of your slow cooker",
        "Dust a clean work surface with flour",
        "Knead dough briefly with floured hands to get rid of any air pockets",
        "Shape into a round or oval loaf depending on the shape of your slow cooker",
        "Sprinkle some of the sesame seeds on the bottom of the slow cooker",
        "Sprinkle remaining seeds generously all around the loaf",
        "Place dough in the slow cooker and cover with the lid",
        "Cook on High for 2 hours",
        "Lift the lid a couple of times during cooking to release the steam",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted deep into the loaf should read between 200 and 210 degrees F (93 to 99 degrees C)",
        "The surface of the bread should be dry and no longer spongy",
        "Remove the loaf and tap the bottom; it should sound hollow",
        "Remove loaf from the slow cooker",
        "Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before cutting, at least 1 hour"
