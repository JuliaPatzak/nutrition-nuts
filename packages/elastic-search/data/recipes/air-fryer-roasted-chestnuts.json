        "Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Bring a large pot of water to boil",
        "Remove from heat",
        "Wash and dry the chestnuts",
        "Place flat side down on a cutting board",
        "Using a paring knife, score a large \u201cX\u201d in the rounded side, covering at least half of the chestnut",

        "Place 1 cup hot water inside the basket",
        "Cook for 10 minutes",
        "Shake well",
        "Check to see if there is still water inside",
        "If not, add another 1/2 cup",
        "Continue cooking until the shells have peeled away and exposed flesh has browned, 5 to 10 minutes more",
        "Remove and allow to cool enough to be handled",
