    "summary": "My mom has been making the stew for many years and it is by far the BEST stew I have ever tasted. It is hearty, filling, and inexpensive not to mention extremely delicious and fairly easy to make. The hardest part and the most time-consuming part for this stew is preparing the vegetables. I chop and dice all my vegetables by hand and so it can consume a little bit more time, but it is very much worth the extra time it takes. Pork, beef, or venison are all good in this recipe, too.",
