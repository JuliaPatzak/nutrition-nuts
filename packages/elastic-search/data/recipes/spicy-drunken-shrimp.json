    "summary": "This is a warm peel-and-eat shrimp recipe that I tried to duplicate from a little bar-and-grill in Deland, Florida.  The shrimp are boiled in a spicy beer and thyme broth and served hot in a beer mug. Serve with dipping sauces of lemon-butter and hot sauce. I dip first in lemon-butter and then hot sauce, but you will find what works best for you! You will need plenty of paper towels!",
