    "summary": "Muffins are a favorite at my house. They're fast and easy to make too! The basis for this recipe came from the 'Eat Clean Diet'. Changes were made because of things I had on hand at the time. The zucchini was a great way to add veggies and fiber. Make a batch or 2 and freeze them for mornings you're in a hurry or just need a snack! Sometimes I'll warm one up in the microwave and drizzle a little agave nectar over it! Yum!",
