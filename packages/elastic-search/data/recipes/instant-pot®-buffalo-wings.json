    "summary": "Buffalo wings made simple in an Instant Pot\u00ae and without the fry. The Instant Pot\u00ae cooks these to perfection. They hold together for easy handling but as soon as you sink your teeth into them, they are fall-off-the-bone tender. Serve with carrot sticks, celery, and ranch if desired.",
