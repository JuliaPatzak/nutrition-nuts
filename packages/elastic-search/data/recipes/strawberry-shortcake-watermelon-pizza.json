    "summary": "For a fun take on a classic summer entertaining dessert, try this simple strawberry shortcake watermelon pizza. You can use either store-bought or homemade whipped cream (or try a vegan whipped cream recipe). Either way, the key is to serve this right away as the whipped cream can melt pretty quickly.",

    ],
    "directions": [
        "Mix strawberries and sugar together in a medium bowl until the strawberries are thoroughly coated",
