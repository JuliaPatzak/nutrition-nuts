    "summary": "Original recipe is a twist on my Mom's version. Fast and easy dessert, great for fall season when apples are freshest and the cranberries come in. I have made it without the apples or using frozen cranberries. I enjoy it as a dessert and as a breakfast treat around the Thanks-Mas season. Loaded with antioxidants! I have also made a wheat-free version using nut flour. Serve plain or topped with ice cream, whipped cream, or a drizzle of heavy cream.",
