    "summary": "I got this recipe when I was working at a restaurant, when I was a teenager, that is no longer in business. I like the tuna salad in it because it is a little different then most. And this sandwich is just a little different then most. I serve this with small relish tray of olives, pickles or cucumbers, green onions, pickled beets, pickled okra, and sliced tomatoes. Plus a salad of some sort, like a corn salad or pasta salad.",
