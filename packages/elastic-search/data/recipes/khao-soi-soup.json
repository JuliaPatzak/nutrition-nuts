    "summary": "From northern Thailand, a noodle soup with an amazing mix of flavor and texture. My mom made this for me recently, and I fell in love with it. It is a variation on a recipe about street food she found in her local paper. It is quite flavorful, so if you prefer a less spicy dish, reduce the amount of spices.",
