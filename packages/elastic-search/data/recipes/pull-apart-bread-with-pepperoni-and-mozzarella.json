    "summary": "This appetizer-sized bread bite is simple to put together and takes advantage of store-bought rolls. The best part, you can modify the servings for a couple or a crowd. Feel free to change it up and use French bread, a bread boule, etc., as long as it isn't sliced through. Make sure the pepperoni is big enough to be folded in half. Serve with marinara sauce if desired.",
