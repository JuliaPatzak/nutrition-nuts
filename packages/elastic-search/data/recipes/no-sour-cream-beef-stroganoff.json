    "summary": "I tried to find a recipe for beef stroganoff without sour cream because I didn't have any. The one I found didn't have white wine, which I like. So I took two recipes and combined them, tweaked to our taste. My husband and I really enjoyed what I came up with. Serve with Worcestershire (to add a little zing) over rice or buttered egg noodles.",
