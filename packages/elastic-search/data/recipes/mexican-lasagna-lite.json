    "summary": "This is a lower-fat version of a popular Tex-Mex style casserole. You can increase or decrease the number of tortillas used in order to fit your tray. I'm obviously using low- and no-fat ingredients which can be substituted successfully with full fat versions with great results. If needed, this can all be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated to store. Hope you enjoy!",
