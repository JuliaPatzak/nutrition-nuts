    "summary": "Creamy, tangy, and crunchy, with a hint of spice and sweetness from pickles, this reminds me of my grandmother's potato salad served every Easter or any time we had barbecue. She always dotted it with olives for a finishing touch and a perfect briny addition. This is the best classic version of good old-fashioned, Southern-style potato salad.  Not too mayonaissey with just the right amount of tang! Serve with grilled or smoked meats as the perfect side dish.",
