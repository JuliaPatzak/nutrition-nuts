    "ingredients": [
        "2 cloves garlic, crushed",
        "1 cup dry white wine",
        "\u00bc cup sherry",
        "1 pound Brie cheese, rind removed and cubed",
        "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
        "1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg",
        "salt and white pepper to taste"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Rub the garlic all over the inside of your fondue pot, leaving the crushed pieces in the bottom",
        "You can also make fondue in a regular sauce pan and transfer to the fondue pot, but why get two pans all crazy cheesy? Add the white wine and sherry to the pot and heat over medium-low heat",
        "Toss the cheese cubes in cornstarch to coat",
        "When the wine is hot, add the cheese",
        "Stir slowly with a wooden spoon at first and then use a whisk",
        "Stir constantly to keep it from scorching on the bottom of the pot",
        "When the cheese has melted, remove it from the heat and grate in a little nutmeg",
        "Season with salt and pepper to taste",
        "The fondue should be smooth and coat a wooden spoon",
        "If it seems to runny, add more cheese",
        "If it is too thick, add a splash more wine --sparingly",
        "Prepare your fondue pot base and keep fondue warm over low heat",
        "Get out the good linen napkins and set the table"
