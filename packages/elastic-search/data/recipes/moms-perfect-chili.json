    "summary": "Smoky tomato flavors lead the way in this comforting classic. This is the perfect chili recipe in my opinion--it's not so fancy that it's intimidating at all, but it's definitely a step above chili packet recipes and chili beans. Serve topped with desired garnishes, such as jalapeno, green or white white onion, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, and hot sauce.",
