    "summary": "When my boys had a hard time getting to sleep I came up with this warm milk to help calm them. Even now, years after they began drinking it, they still enjoy it during homework, or after coming in from a cold day of play. I, too, have enjoyed it after a long day's work. I hope you enjoy this recipe as well for years to come.",
