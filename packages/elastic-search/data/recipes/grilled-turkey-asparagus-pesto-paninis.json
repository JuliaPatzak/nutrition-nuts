    "summary": "These are fast, yet tasty sandwiches and are best on the grill! The oatmeal bread really gives these paninis great flavor, but you could use another type of hearty bread as well. My husband and I love them in the summer when the asparagus and basil are in season. Serve with a side of coleslaw for a satisfying crunchy side dish.",
