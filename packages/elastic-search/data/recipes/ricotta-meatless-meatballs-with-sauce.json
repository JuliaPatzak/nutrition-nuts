    "summary": "\"Polpette di ricotta al sugo\", as these are known in Italian, are meatless balls made out of ricotta cheese and homemade bread crumbs. Think meatballs, but without the meat! The soft balls are then simmered in a simple homemade tomato sauce. I like to serve these with a side of greens, such as broccoli rabe.",
