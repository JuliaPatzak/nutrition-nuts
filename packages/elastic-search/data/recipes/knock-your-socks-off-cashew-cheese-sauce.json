    "summary": "I was tired of bland, boring cashew cheese sauce recipes that tasted only like nutritional yeast and lemon juice. I decided to experiment and discovered this amazing vegan cheese sauce! My entire family loves it, even the non-vegans! Excellent on macaroni, over a baked potato, drizzled in a burrito, on taco salad, as a veggie or chip dip ... the possibilities are truly endless. I hope you enjoy.",
