    "summary": "There's absolutely nothing wrong with green lentil soup, but once you start making it with black \u2018beluga' lentils, you'll have a hard time going back. These black beauties cook up melt-in-your-mouth tender, but still retain their structural integrity, which gives the soup both a thick, satisfying body, and a light, non-starchy mouthfeel.",
