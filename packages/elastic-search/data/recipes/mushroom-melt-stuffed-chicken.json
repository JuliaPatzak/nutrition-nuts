    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and mushrooms with salt and pepper until the mushrooms are dark and juicy, about 5 minutes",
        "Remove skillet from heat and stir in the bread crumbs",
        "Set aside",
        "Place each chicken breast half between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface",
        "Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an thickness of about 1/4 inch",
        "Lay a flattened chicken breast out onto a work surface, and place a slice of ham on the chicken",
        "Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the mushroom stuffing onto the chicken breast, and top with about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the Havarti cheese",
        "Roll the chicken breast around the stuffing, wrap 2 slices of bacon firmly around each roll, and secure with toothpicks",
        "Place the rolls into a 9x13-inch baking dish",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the stuffing is melted and hot, about 35 minutes",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a roll should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)",
        "Remove the chicken rolls from the oven, and place an oven rack about 6 inches from the oven's broiler heat source",
        "Turn on the broiler, and broil the rolls until the bacon is brown, 5 to 10 more minutes"
