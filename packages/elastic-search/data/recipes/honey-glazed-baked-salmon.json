    "summary": "I got this recipe from a friend and, as a new cook, it is easy to make and delicious to boot! Even when I make this recipe with fewer pieces of salmon (2 small salmon filets), I still make the same amount of honey glaze, because it is so delicious and I prefer having more sauce rather than not enough.",
