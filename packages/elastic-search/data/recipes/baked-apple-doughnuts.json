    "summary": "These easy and delicious baked apple doughnuts are tender, sweet, and studded with pieces of tart apple. The trick is to coat the dough in lots of cinnamon sugar, and then bake them so they are still soft on the inside and have a wonderful sugar crust on the outside. Enjoy with coffee and a crossword!",
