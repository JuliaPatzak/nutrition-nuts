    "summary": "Though restaurant naan is usually cooked in the intense heat of the tandoor oven, you can pull off this homemade version using a hot cast iron skillet. When cooked at the proper temperature, the naan will develop blistered bubbles with a lovely golden-black char. Reward yourself for a job well done by sopping it in copious amounts of curry.",
