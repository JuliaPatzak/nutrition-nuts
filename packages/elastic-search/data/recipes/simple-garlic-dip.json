    "summary": "This easy garlic dip is one of the first things to disappear at gatherings. No matter what other appetizers are available, this is what people crowd around to eat. Add more or less garlic to taste. We have friends that add so much garlic your mouth burns after a few bites. Great for watching football and at BBQs!",
