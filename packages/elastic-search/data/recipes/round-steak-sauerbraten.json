    "summary": "This isn't traditional Sauerbraten, but a great, easy substitute using round steak. My mom made this dish when I was a kid. I started making it when my kids were young, and we all love it!! Try serving over buttered noodles. If your crew is really hungry, then double the recipe. The single recipe is never enough for my family of four.",
