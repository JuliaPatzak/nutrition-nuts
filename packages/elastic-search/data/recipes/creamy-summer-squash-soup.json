    "ingredients": [
        "6 small yellow summer squash, trimmed and coarsely chopped",
        "1 large zucchini, trimmed and coarsely chopped",
        "2 cups vegetable stock",
        "1 cup half-and-half cream",
        "2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon",
        "1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese",
        "ground white pepper to taste",

    "directions": [
        "Place the summer squash, zucchini, vegetable stock, half-and-half, and tarragon into a large soup pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes",
        "Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree",
        "Puree in batches until nearly smooth, and pour into a clean pot",
        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot",
        "Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese into the hot soup, and allow to melt; stir until thoroughly mixed",
        "Stir in the lemon juice, and top with a sprinkling of tarragon to serve"
