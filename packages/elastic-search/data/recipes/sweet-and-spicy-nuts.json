    "summary": "The first time I made this I had a small tub of raw nuts in my cabinet and didn't know what to do with them.  My mom gave me the recipe, and after I made it I couldn't stop eating them.  I am not a nut person, but I am totally addicted to these coated nuts. They're perfect for parties and festive occasions!",
