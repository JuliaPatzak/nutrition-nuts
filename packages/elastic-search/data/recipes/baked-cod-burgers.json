    "summary": "These fish burgers make a light fare that is perfect for a summer evening. I invented this to get my 5-year-old son to eat fish, and it was a hit! He ate his in record time. We prefer cod, but I am sure it would translate to any mild white fish. It goes great with a fresh baby spinach salad topped with tomatoes, avocado, and crumbled feta.",
