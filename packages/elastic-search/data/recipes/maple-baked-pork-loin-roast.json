    "summary": "This is a GREAT recipe.  Do not let the ingredients scare you, they combine to make a really great taste.  The pork is so moist and tender that it will fall apart when you go to cut it.  I find it comes out best with the loin that has two sections.  If it is a single loin, it still comes out great, but does not fall apart quite so much. Everyone who tries this loves it so far. It's my husband's favorite and very easy to make. It cooks for 1 hr 45 min - 2 hrs.",
