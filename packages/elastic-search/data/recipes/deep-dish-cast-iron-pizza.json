    "summary": "A buttery, thick, and chewy pizza dough that is baked in a cast iron skillet. Pizza never tasted so good! Toppings are substantial but not overwhelming where the dough won't cook. If you cook the sausage while the dough is proofing you'll be ready to assemble the pizza that much faster.",
