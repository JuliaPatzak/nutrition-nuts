    "summary": "This recipe was one of those great surprises you invent by throwing everything you have in the house together.  It is a very versatile recipe in that you can substitute any chicken parts for the thighs, use whatever vegetables and herbs you have in the house, or any cheese you prefer.  I have used broccoli when I have no zucchini on hand, and added dill when I have some of that.  Any way you make it, it is an easy weeknight meal that has a sauce that is delicious over rice.",
