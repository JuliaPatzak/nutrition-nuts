    "summary": "I miss my Grandparents dearly. Grandpa loved to cook while Grandma knitted on the sofa.  This helps brings them back to me. This recipe was one of my favorites growing up. It's an old-fashioned, slow-cooking, lick-the-bowl, stick-to-your-ribs type of soup.   The family loves it. It's traditional at holiday time with a nice slice of rye bread to dip in it.",
