    "summary": "I made a few changes to a recipe on the back of a canister of oats. Now this is the only one I use.  I often use hazelnuts in place of the pecans, and they are just as good. I hope you enjoy them as much as we do. You can make these larger or smaller; simply adjust the baking time. Keep loosely covered, and they will maintain their chewiness for several days, if they last that long.",
