    "summary": "Sweet potatoes (minus the sweet). These are best served hot! The inside mixture will cool things down so it's edible. Remember real butter. Temperatures are important because they create the textures. I hope you all enjoy! I have turned non-sweet potato eaters into sweet potato lovers with this recipe. If you're not into onions you can use celery.",
