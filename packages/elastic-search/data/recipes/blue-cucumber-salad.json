    "summary": "Move over, plain jane cucumber salad! This salad makes an entrance with unusual chunks of blue cheese tossed in for a creamy burst of flavor. If blue cheese is too strong for you, try a mild feta and a squirt of lemon! When testing this recipe, both light and regular sour cream held up well, while the fat free version tended to water out quickly.",
