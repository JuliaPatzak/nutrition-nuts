    "summary": "This has become our favorite fish recipe. Besides being very tasty, it is a quick and easy recipe. We use black cod (US name) or sablefish. Pollock can be used. A while ago I found a similar recipe in a grocery store; it was good but need some tweaking. Basically I toned down the tomato topping, increased the Parmesan, decreased the mustard sauce and modified the cook time. In our opinion these changes made a better balance of flavors. Despite the four serving count, we found that one pound of black cod is just about the right amount for the two of us. Serve with Pinot Gris and French bread.",
