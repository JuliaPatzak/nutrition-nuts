    "summary": "This is a great, easy hot appetizer. Pepperidge Farm\u00ae sandwich bread works great with this recipe, as it's square and firm. I make these ahead, freeze them on a cookie sheet, store them in a freezer bag, then cook them as I need them. Wonderful if friends drop by during the holidays!",
