    "summary": "Once you try making a whole chicken in the slow cooker, you'll never want to roast it the old way again. In the slow cooker you'll get the moistest, most fool-proof, and hands-off whole chicken that you'll ever make. This recipe uses generous amounts of rosemary and garlic that not only infuse into the chicken, but also season the potatoes that cook underneath the chicken for a savory one-pot meal.",
