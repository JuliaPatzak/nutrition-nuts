    "summary": "I am making an effort to eliminate refined sugar. This recipe has replaced the packs of overly-sweetened instant oatmeal I ate, thinking that it was healthy. Now, I make this every Sunday and take it to work for the rest of the week. At less than 100 calories per serving, it feels hearty but keeps me on track.",
