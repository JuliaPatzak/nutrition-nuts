    "summary": "This is something a friend of mine showed me. It's super easy, not to mention delicious. I try to eat according to the paleolithic diet and this fits wonderfully. The portions are quite large, so it can easily feed more than 2 or you can have some for lunch the next day. Feel free to change amounts according to taste, especially in regards to the onion, cilantro, lemon juice and olive oil.",
