    "summary": "This is my family's traditional St. Patrick's Day bread. My grandmother has had this recipe for longer than I've been alive. I was SHOCKED to find out this wasn't real Irish Soda Bread, but instead more commonly known as Spotted Dog. Whatever you call it, it is unbeatable topped with a bit of butter.",
