    "ingredients": [
        "7  Yukon Gold potatoes",
        "\u00bc cup butter, melted",
        "1 teaspoon white sugar",
        "1 cup all-purpose flour"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Place the unpeeled potatoes in cold water and bring to a boil",
        "When potatoes are almost soft, drain water and allow potatoes to cool",
        "Make sure the potatoes do not get too soft, or they will be too wet and the lefse will be hard",
        "Peel and mash the potatoes",
        "Measure out 4 cups; set aside and allow to cool",
        "Preheat your cast iron or electric skillet to a medium setting",
        "Stir the butter and sugar into  4 cups mashed potatoes",
        "Add about one cup of flour and mix it into the potatoes",
        "The amount of flour needs to be varied a little according to how moist the mashed potatoes are, the less flour you use the better, but you don't want the mixture to be sticky",
        "Flour your pastry board and rolling pin",
        "Make a ball of lefse dough about the size of a small apple and roll it out into a very thin circle",
        "It should be as thin as a crepe, and will tear easily unless you are very careful",
        "Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat",
        "Lightly brown the lefse on both sides on your skillet, from 1 to 3 minutes per side",
        "Roll up and serve with the filling of your choice"
