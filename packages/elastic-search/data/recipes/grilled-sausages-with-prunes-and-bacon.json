    "summary": "My husband's grandmother gave me this recipe. The combo of sweet prunes, salty bacon and meaty sausages is delicious. This recipe is great with any fresh, large sausage (just not the wee breakfast-style sausages). Sometimes I use sweet Italian, sometimes spiced Italian, sometimes bratwurst, sometimes knockwurst, and sometimes just local pork sausage. Serve in buns with all the usual fixin's (sauerkraut, mustard, relish, etc.).",
