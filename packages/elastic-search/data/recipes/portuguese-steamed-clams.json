    "summary": "Being of Portuguese descent and raised in Rhode Island along the Eastern seaboard, this recipe is a wonderful combination of my two heritages. If desired serve with a small cup of melted butter for dipping clams and don't forget a fresh loaf of warm, crusty bread!!! Note: If the clams seem sandy, soak them for a couple of hours or overnight in the refrigerator in salted water with a bit of vinegar, cornmeal, and cayenne pepper.",
