    "summary": "This recipe was born out of frustration and desperation when I realized I had a gallon of buttermilk to use up and a school bake sale the next day. The nice part is it made 2 pies. The bad part is I had to bake them twice because we wolfed down the first 2 with chocolate whipped cream! The texture of the pie is phenomenal. With the white chocolate chips, orange zest, and blossom water, there is no buttermilk 'bite', just great flavor.",
