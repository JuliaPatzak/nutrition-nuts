        "1 pound halibut fillet",
        "1 teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt",
        "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger",
        "3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion",
        "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon light soy sauce",

        "Pat halibut dry with paper towels",
        "Rub both sides of fillet with salt",
        "Scatter the ginger over the top of the fish and place onto a heatproof ceramic dish",
        "Place into a bamboo steamer set over several inches of gently boiling water, and cover",
        "Gently steam for 10 to 12 minutes",
        "Pour accumulated water out of the dish and sprinkle the fillet with green onion",
        "Drizzle both soy sauces over the surface of the fish",
