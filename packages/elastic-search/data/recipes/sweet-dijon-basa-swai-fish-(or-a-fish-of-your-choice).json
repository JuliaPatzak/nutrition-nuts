    "summary": "Did you know that Basa can be as little as $3.99 a pound at most grocery stores? Yup and this hidden treasure is the most delicious, tender, fish I have ever had. It goes well with all fish recipes and is a great substitute for expensive fish. This recipe was so good my family wanted it again the very next day! Its sweet and tangy and just down right delicious.",
