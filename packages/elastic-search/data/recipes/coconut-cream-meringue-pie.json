    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Stir half-and-half, coconut milk, eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a saucepan; stirring constantly, slowly bring to a boil over low heat and cook until thick, about 30 minutes",
        "Remove saucepan from heat; fold 3/4 cup coconut into the mixture with the vanilla extract",
        "Pour the coconut mixture into the baked pie crust",
        "Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy",
        "Gradually add cream of tartar and 6 tablespoons white sugar, continuing to beat until soft peaks form",
        "Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak",
        "Spread egg white mixture over the pie",
        "Sprinkle 1/2 cup coconut over the pie",
        "Bake in preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes",
