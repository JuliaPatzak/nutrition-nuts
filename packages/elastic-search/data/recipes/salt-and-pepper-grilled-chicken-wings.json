    "summary": "I love to order salt and pepper squid at our local Chinese take-out restaurant. I thought the spice blend would be fantastic on grilled chicken wings. I order the Szechuan peppercorns online and roast them as I need them. Don't worry if there is more spice blend than you need, it keeps for quite some time in a sealed container and you'll find yourself sprinkling it on a variety of different things.",
