    "summary": "There was a movie in the 1980s called Seems Like Old Times starring Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. One of the recurring themes in this movie was Goldie Hawn's character's ability to cook an amazing dish called Chicken Pepperoni. I had never heard of Chicken Pepperoni before, but I thought it sounded delicious. So I decided to put some ingredients together and gave it the ol' college try. It came out delicious!",
