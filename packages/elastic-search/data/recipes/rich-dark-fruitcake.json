    "summary": "This is my mother's very old recipe, at least 60 years old.  My mother baked this for my wedding, and it sure is delicious and also a great Christmas cake.  This is a very long recipe, but well worth the trouble.  You can substitute a cup of drained maraschino cherries for the candied cherries, if you like.",
