    "summary": "I had this idea to modify a brownie recipe - and it worked! I substituted all of the chocolate in a brownie recipe with a condensed blueberry syrup I made using fresh blueberries. It retains the brownie texture, although it is a little more cake-like. But, the surprising thing was that it tastes really good! I adjusted the sugar and added cinnamon. The cake is deep purple all the way through. This was a neat experiment!",
