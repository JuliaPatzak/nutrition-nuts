    "summary": "This is an old-fashioned upside-down cake recipe from my German grandmother from scratch. She used this same cake batter for many different fruits as an alternative to pineapple. She often used fresh Italian prunes or pitted fresh cherries. My grandparents owned a bakery and this cake was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.",
