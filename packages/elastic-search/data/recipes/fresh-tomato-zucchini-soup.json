    "summary": "At a point of abundance with tomatoes and zucchini from my garden I came up with this soup. A friend said it was like a soup you would get at one of those chic 5 star restaurants! Serve with crusty French bread and salad. This soup tastes wonderful after a little cooking or simmering a long time. Sometimes I add cooked rice to give a bit more substance.",
