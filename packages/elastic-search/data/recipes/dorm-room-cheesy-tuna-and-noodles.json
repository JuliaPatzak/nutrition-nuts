    "summary": "Cheap, easy, cheesy tuna and noodles for college students on a shoe string budget. If you really wanna dress it up, you can add thinly sliced almonds or sunflower seeds for more flavor and texture.  Of course this defeats the purpose of it being cheap and easy, but at least it's more enjoyable.",
