    "directions": [
        "Place squash cubes into a steamer basket in a saucepan",
        "Add water, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat",
        "Allow to steam until the squash is tender (10 to 15 minutes), then drain, and mash in a bowl with a fork",
        "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat",
        "Add onion; cook and stir for 2 minutes until the onion begins to soften, then stir in the rice",
        "Continue cooking and stirring until the rice is glossy from the butter, and the onion begins to brown on the edges, about 5 minutes more",
        "Pour in the white wine; cook, stirring constantly, until it has evaporated",
        "Stir in the mashed squash and 1/3 of the hot chicken stock; reduce heat to medium",
