    "summary": "The following is a basic spicy sushi roll, readily suitable for either crab or tuna. Different people will be suited to different degrees of spiciness for the sauce, so you may want to adjust proportions accordingly to your liking. Final product will be cool and slightly sweet at first, with a tight, hot afterbite following, and then linger for a while after with a duller burning, flavorful taste.",
