    "summary": "This is a very easy and quick recipe. There are additional variations to enhance your rice experience. To add some kick to it, add a can of mixed veggies and decrease the chicken stock from 4 cups to 3 3/4 cups. Or you can add a can of beans to it. If you add beans, do not decrease the chicken stock. You can also add meat, sausage, ham, or even shrimp. If adding meat, no need to decrease chicken stock. You can add more salt or seasonings to taste.",
