    "summary": "Bone-in chicken breasts stuffed with spinach, cheese and onion and baked until tender. This is a simple recipe that I cooked up myself. It is, however, based on some pretty standard Greek/Italian dishes. Everyone loves this and it can be wonderful for company - even people who don't usually like spinach find that they like this dish! Serve with your favorite shaped pasta, if desired.",
