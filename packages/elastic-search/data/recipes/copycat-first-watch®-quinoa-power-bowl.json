    "summary": "This is a copycat recipe of First Watch\u00ae's Quinoa Power Bowl. I think you are really going to enjoy this protein-packed quinoa mixed with grilled chicken, lemon, feta, roasted tomatoes, and shredded carrots. The recipe is quite simple, and the dish is a complete meal all-in-one, so it takes the guesswork out of what side dishes to prepare to ensure a balanced meal of protein, whole grains, and fresh veggies.",
