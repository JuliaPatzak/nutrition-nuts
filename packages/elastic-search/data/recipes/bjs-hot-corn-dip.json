    "summary": "This recipe is a hot version of a classic corn dip, both in spice and temperature, that is very tasty indeed.  It is a culmination of several variations and is my version 7, thus lending itself well to your creativity.  Experiment with different corn, peppers, cheeses, etc. Serve with yellow or white tortilla chips. I hope you like it.",
