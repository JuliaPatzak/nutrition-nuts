    "summary": "My husband and his friends love to munch on these when they get together to watch basketball or football. Warning!!! These are NOT for the taster who's mild at heart!! You can also bake the peppers in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes; broil 1 to 2 minutes to crisp the bacon. Red or yellow bell peppers cam be substituted to lower the heat.",
