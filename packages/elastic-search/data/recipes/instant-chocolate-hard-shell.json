    "summary": "Two ingredients and less than 5 minutes to a delicious chocolate candy shell for ice cream. After trying recipe after recipe that turned out either rock hard or thick gummy hard shells - I thought to read the ingredient list on a bottle of the store stuff and came up with this! You can use any oil that has NO flavor or has a flavor compatible with chocolate and your ice cream - canola or soybean work ok here, but the coconut oil sends the flavor over the top and makes it a tad crunchier! Drizzle on top of your favorite ice cream!",
