    "summary": "Using an Instant Pot\u00ae speeds up this easy dip that is delicious! I may or may not have eaten the leftovers (which I squirreled away from my kiddos) for breakfast. This dip is also paleo and Whole30\u00ae friendly! For dipping, serve with cucumber, red and yellow peppers, plantain chips, or radishes. The final baking step is optional.",
