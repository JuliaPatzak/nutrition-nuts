    "summary": "My mom designed this recipe to free up the stove by using the rice cooker to steam and stew chicken thighs, yielding tender, almost slow-cooked chicken with a comforting taste.  It takes a while to make, but requires minimal work.  You can use any cut of chicken, but dark meats come out especially soft.  Serve with white rice and enjoy!",
