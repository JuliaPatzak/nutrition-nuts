    "summary": "Two types of naturally gluten-free manioc starch (not tapioca) mixed with cheeses are a traditional recipe for Brazilian cheese rolls, but these are made in an air fryer instead of the oven. This cuts down baking time, and still gives you soft, chewy rolls. It is important to use both types of starches for the right flavor. They can be found in most Latin or South American grocery stores or even online.",
