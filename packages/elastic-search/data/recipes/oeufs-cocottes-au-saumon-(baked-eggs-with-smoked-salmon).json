    "summary": "These French baked eggs with smoked salmon are to die for and a true gourmet breakfast. The difficulty when baking eggs is to get the whites cooked evenly yet have the yolk still be runny. That's why the eggs are baked in two stages: first just the egg white is baked with cream and salmon, and the yolk is added later. Scale up the recipe as needed.",
