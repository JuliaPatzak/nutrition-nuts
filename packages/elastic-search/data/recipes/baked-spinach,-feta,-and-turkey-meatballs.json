    "summary": "These spinach, feta, and turkey meatballs are quick and easy to make, easy to freeze, and taste great when reheated. My son and I call these \"Combine Nuggets.\" Did you know that a combine is a giant tractor that harvests crops from the field? Well, I most certainly didn't until my 3-year-old told me! Therefore, thanks to the hardworking combines we can put the green things in our nuggets.",
