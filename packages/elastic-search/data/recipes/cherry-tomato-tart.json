    "summary": "This tart came about as a way to use up some odds-and-ends ingredients that I had been wanting to get used up.  Make sure to place a baking sheet under the tart pan while baking--those tomatoes can make a bit of a mess when they burst open! They add quite a bit of juice, which can pool on top a little. I simply dabbed up extra juice with a paper towel and that worked fine. This is best served warm, on the day it's made. Garnish with additional basil, if desired.",
