    "summary": "These cookies are soft and chewy and didn't last a day after making them! Once I thought I HATED coconut, but these made me realize I just didn't like overly sweet coconut. These are fabulous! Made with whole wheat flour and oatmeal, it's a better alternative to the traditional cookie.",
