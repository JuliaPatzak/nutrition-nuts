    "summary": "This is about as simple as a bread recipe can be.  It's great tasting, crusty, yeasty, coarse-textured, satisfying bread.  I'm a guy, and I can make this perfect every time.  This bread is the exact of opposite of all the other soft, fine-textured, preservative laden, over-priced supermarket breads. It's easiest if you use a stand-type mixer with bread hooks.  If you don't have one, buy one.  It'll be the most-used appliance in your kitchen, next to the toaster.",
