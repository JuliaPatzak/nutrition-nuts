    "summary": "I was trying to use up some papaya and ripe bananas and found a papaya bread recipe that I could easily modify. I loved the idea of adding ginger to give it a bit of a bite. It turned out amazing and I've had several requests for the recipe already! Enjoy. Serve at room temperature or warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",
