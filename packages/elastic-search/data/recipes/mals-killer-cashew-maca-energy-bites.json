    "summary": "This is my copycat-version of a bliss ball that I discovered at a local juice bar. These little guys taste amazing! They're raw, vegan, gluten-free, and fabulous. Maca root is a powerful superfood! These little bites pack a wallop and taste phenomenal! Kind of like a cardamom-laced salted caramel snack. Enjoy!",
