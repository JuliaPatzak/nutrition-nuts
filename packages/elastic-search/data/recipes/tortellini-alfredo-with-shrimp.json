    "summary": "I was looking in the freezer trying to figure out what to make for supper when I saw tortellini and shrimp, so I thought that it would be good in an Alfredo sauce. The smaller the shrimp, the better the blend. I posted this recipe on our local TV station's site and it went nationwide. I have also received 5-star reviews on this recipe. I serve this at our local Elk's club.",
