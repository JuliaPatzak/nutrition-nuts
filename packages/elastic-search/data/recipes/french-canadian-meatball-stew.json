    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Spread flour out in a thin, even layer on a baking sheet",
        "Roast the flour in the preheated oven until medium brown in color, 10 to 15 minutes; stir often and watch carefully to avoid burning",
        "Remove the flour from the baking sheet immediately once the desired color has been reached; set aside in a shallow bowl to cool",
        "Melt butter in a large, heavy pot over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes",
        "Transfer the onion to a large mixing bowl",
        "In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; stir the spice mix into the onion",
        "Place ground pork, parsley, egg, and bread crumbs into the bowl, and mix to combine thoroughly",
        "Form the meat mixture into 1-inch meatballs; roll each meatball in the roasted flour",
        "Reserve unused flour",
        "Pour the chicken broth into the pot, bring to a boil over medium heat, and carefully drop in the meatballs, a few at a time, stirring to keep them from sticking on the bottom",
        "Drop in the bay leaf",
        "Simmer the meatballs for 20 minutes; mix in the potatoes, and simmer until potatoes are tender and the broth has reduced, an additional 20 minutes",
        "Transfer the meatballs into a bowl with a slotted spoon",
        "Remove and discard bay leaf",
        "Mix remaining roasted flour with cold water in a cup, and gradually whisk the flour mixture into the simmering broth to thicken",
        "Bring the gravy to a full boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes",
        "Return the meatballs to the stew, and serve"
