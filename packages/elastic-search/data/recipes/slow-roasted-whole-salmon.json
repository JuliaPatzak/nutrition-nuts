    "summary": "Fresh salmon is stuffed with herbs and onions, wrapped in aluminum foil, and slow-roasted, resulting in an elegant and absolutely delicious dish that looks stunning on a buffet. Garnish with fresh herbs, lemon slices, and capers. I usually put a small wedge of tomato in the mouth and a caper or slice of stuffed olive over the eye.",
