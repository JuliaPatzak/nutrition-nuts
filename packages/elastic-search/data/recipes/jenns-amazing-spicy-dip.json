    "summary": "My best friend Jenn made this recipe for football party we were having at our house, and it was the hit of the night! You can make it as mild or spicy as you like. I have so many people asking me for this recipe, so I thought I'd share it on here. If you cannot find Italian sausage meat, you can buy the Italian sausage in the casing and squeeze it out. Enjoy with tortilla chips.",
