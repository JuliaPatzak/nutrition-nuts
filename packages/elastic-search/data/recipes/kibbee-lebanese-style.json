    "summary": "Simple Lebanese style lamb kibbee. It's a traditional basic recipe. Kibbee is to Middle Eastern cooking what a meatball is to Italian cooking. If you can not make it, stay out of the kitchen. I am not Lebanese by the way, but worked for 2 decades in a restaurant serving this type of food. I am actually Ukrainian.",
