    "summary": "This is my husband's favorite dressing, and it is the best dressing to use in taco salad. The original dressing was made in St. Paul, Nebraska and is sold in the midwest but is becoming more expensive. This recipe is very similar to the store version and uses products I regularly have in my pantry. We love it.",
