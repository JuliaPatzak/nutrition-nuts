    "summary": "This recipe allows you to make the muffin batter the night before, then bake it the next morning--perfect for fresh, on-the-go muffins! Make sure not to overmix the batter as that will create dense muffins that won't rise well. The batter will last in the fridge up to 5 days which means you can make a few muffins at a time over the course of a few days, if you desire.",
