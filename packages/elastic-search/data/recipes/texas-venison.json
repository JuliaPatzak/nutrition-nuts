    "summary": "This is a great way to spice up venison for those who tend to shy away from it. It is similar to Carne Guisada, and goes well as a main course or a filling in a tortilla. Venison comes out moist and tender in a slow cooker or pressure cooker. This also works well with beef or pork.",
