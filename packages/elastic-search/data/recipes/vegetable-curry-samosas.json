    "summary": "These samosas have a unique twist, they have curry and a dip. You can add chicken or ground beef and make it a meal. Good to double and triple for leftovers, and with these you don't know how many everyone will want, they are really good. At the age of 12, I alone ate 10 small ones. I was so full!",
