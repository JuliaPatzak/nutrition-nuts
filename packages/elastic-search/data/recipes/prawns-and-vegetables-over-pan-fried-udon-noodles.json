    "summary": "This is my own creation. It's fast, easy, nutritious, and affordable. Great for dinner on a weeknight when everyone is busy. I will halve the recipe when I'm only cooking for myself or double it when I am cooking for my whole family because it converts easily. Also, one recipe will feed 4 children, as portion sizes are generous.",
