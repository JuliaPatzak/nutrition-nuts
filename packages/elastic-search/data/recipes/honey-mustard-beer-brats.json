    "summary": "This recipe is very easy and makes delicious bratwurst.  My guests always ask for these during football season.  You won't be able to get enough onions and peppers in the slow cooker because every time we make them, we run out!  This recipe is for 10.  If you have a very large slow cooker, you can get 15 in, but most can only hold 10 (you may need another slow cooker if making more).",
