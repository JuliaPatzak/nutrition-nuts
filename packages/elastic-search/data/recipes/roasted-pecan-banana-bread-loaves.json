    "summary": "My father loves bananas and pecans, so for his birthday this year I whipped up a special treat for him: two of his favorites, wrapped into one, and made into individual loaves so he could easily freeze the extras and have his birthday banana bread whenever he wanted. (Coconut extract helps to bring out the fresh banana flavor - trust!) The flavor is better a day later.",
