    "summary": "I love scallops, particularly bay scallops. This is a quick and easy way I've found to prepare them. It has become a regular at my house. If you prefer a thicker sauce, make a slurry out of a teaspoon water mixed with a teaspoon of cornstarch and stir into the boiling liquid to tighten it up. Serve with crusty bread for an easy weeknight meal.",
