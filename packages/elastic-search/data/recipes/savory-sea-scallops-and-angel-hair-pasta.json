    "ingredients": [
        "1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta",
        "\u00bc cup butter",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry",
        "3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
        "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
        "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
        "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
        "\u00bd cup heavy cream  (Optional)",
        "1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste  (Optional)"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat",
        "Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil",
        "Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes",
        "Drain well in a colander set in the sink",
        "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat",
        "Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute",
        "Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly; stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet",
        "Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, 2 to 3 minutes",
        "Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked",
        "Stir in lemon juice, and season with salt and black pepper",
        "Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce",
        "Bring the mixture just to a bare simmer",
        "Serve over hot angel hair pasta; sprinkle to taste with Parmesan cheese"
