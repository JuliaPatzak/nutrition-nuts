    "summary": "My late mother created this recipe over thirty years ago. My grandparents, my father, and myself have enjoyed these baked stuffed shrimp every other Friday for many years. It's a tradition - we eat baked stuffed shrimp for dinner and then play cards! (We've been leaving out the scallops lately due to the high price, and we don't even miss them.) We serve the shrimp with a nice garden salad and rice pilaf or baked potato.",
