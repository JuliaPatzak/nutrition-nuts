    "summary": "Ekmek is a light and slightly sour flatbread that tastes wonderful with Havarti cheese. It uses a starter which ferments for 4 days. I recommend using a pizza stone to bake the loaves on.  If you've no pizza stone,  cookie sheets will work also. The recipe seems complicated, but it's a lot easier than it appears.",
