    "summary": "This is how my Brazilian mom prepares pork ribs. Boiling the ribs with the seasonings ensures that the meat will remain moist and juicy, and that the flavors will fully penetrate the meat. I hope you like these as much as I always have! Serve with lime wedges, rice and a fresh green salad.",

        "10  pork spareribs",
        "\u00bd cup soy sauce",
        "10 cloves garlic, crushed",
        "1 tablespoon dried rosemary",
        "1 tablespoon dried oregano",

        "Place the spareribs into a large pot, and fill with just enough water to cover",
        "Add the soy sauce, garlic, rosemary, oregano, bay leaves, lime juice and 3/4 of the parsley",
        "Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered over medium heat until the water has completely evaporated, about 25 minutes",
