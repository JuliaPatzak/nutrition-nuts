    "summary": "When you're in the mood for barbecued pork you basically have 2 options: ribs or a slowly smoked pork shoulder made into pulled pork. But what if you want something different? In that case, these barbecued pork skewers come highly recommended. And no, we're not just sticking chunks of pork on a stick, this is way more advanced and way more delicious. Garnish with thinly sliced green onion and drizzle with extra barbecue sauce if you like.",
