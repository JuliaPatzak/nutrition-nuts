    "summary": "A cousin to poutine, loaded nacho swamp taters use the nacho cheese sauce as the gravy. So, it's loaded with nacho cheese sauce, and taco-seasoned ground beef. Layer shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sour cream on top. I also used some dried cilantro for garnish. My son loves sriracha, and that is also a nice heat kick for these. For even more heat, consider putting more jalapenos on top of the taters, along with salsa or hot sauce.",
