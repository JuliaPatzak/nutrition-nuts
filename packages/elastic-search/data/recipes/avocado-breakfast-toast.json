    "summary": "My own twist on the traditional popular breakfast avocado toast. I make this all the time but never measure anything.  For Mother's Day, my mom requested that I write this recipe down for her, so I attempted to measure as I went. And after I wrote it all down, I then decided that, since this is the third time someone's asked me for the recipe, maybe I should include it here. Feel free to play with the spices, as I normally always just add to taste. The cheese I typically use is just whatever I have on hand at the time. Sometimes pepper Jack or sharp Cheddar, but mostly the star here is the avocado spread which I've tweaked over the years. I hope you all enjoy.",
