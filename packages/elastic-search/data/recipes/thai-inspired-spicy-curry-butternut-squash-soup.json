    "summary": "Love Thai flavors and I felt they would be a perfect match to play off the richness of a butternut squash soup. Curry, coconut, spicy are a wonderful to balance the richness of the squash. The first time I made it was kind of an accident. I was trying to make the traditional soup but when I tasted it lacked something. I looked to see how I could punch up the flavor. First I added the curry, I had some leftover red curry paste I made, added coconut milk and I felt I had something special. Like many soups and stews the flavor is better the following day. Enjoy!",
