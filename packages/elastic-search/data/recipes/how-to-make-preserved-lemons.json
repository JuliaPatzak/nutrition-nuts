        "8  lemons, or more to taste",
        "1 cup kosher salt",
        "1 (32-ounce) wide-mouthed Mason jar with a plastic, non-reactive lid"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Trim ends off lemons",
        "Cut halfway into each lemon, lengthwise, and again widthwise, like a plus sign",
        "Push the cut sides open and spread slightly",
        "Place about 2 tablespoons of salt into the bottom of the jar; place 1 lemon, cut-side down, over salt",
        "Press lemon into the salt using a long wooden stick to release juices",
        "Repeat layering remaining salt and lemons",
        "Press lemons to get all the juices out",
        "Squeeze in some additional lemon juice if layers are very dry, but avoid a soupy texture",
        "Cover jar with lid; flip jar upside-down onto a shallow dish to protect against possible leaking",
        "Let sit in a cool spot away from direct light or refrigerate, flipping jar over every 2 to 3 days, about 3 weeks"
