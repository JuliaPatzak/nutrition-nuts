    "summary": "This pie is delicious! I got the recipe from my husband's mother.  She is French so I believe this is a French Meat Pie. Beef, pork, and potato are all nicely spiced and baked into a pie.  It's yummy and pretty easy to make too! Best served fresh, but you can also make ahead and freeze or refrigerate.",
