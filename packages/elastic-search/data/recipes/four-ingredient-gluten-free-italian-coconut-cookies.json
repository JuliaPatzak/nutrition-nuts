    "summary": "These traditional Italian soft cookies are a hit at any get-together.  I've made them gluten free but you can use the same amount of all-purpose wheat flour instead of gluten-free flour. There are many variations of this cookie in Italy. Some people add chocolate chips and some drizzle dark chocolate over them once cooled.",
