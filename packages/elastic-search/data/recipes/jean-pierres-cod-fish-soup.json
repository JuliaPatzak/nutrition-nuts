    "summary": "While living in Paris, I went to a wonderful hole-in-the wall that featured a fish broth similar to this one. Jean-Pierre, the owner, chef, and sole waiter, demonstrated the proper method of eating it. First, you spread mayo over the croutons, then top them with cheese, float them in the broth, spoon soup over them, and finally, scoop them up and eat them while they're still crunchy. To die for!",
