    "summary": "This recipe was a request for a bride to be who was struggling because of her allergy to eggs. After making it for her bridal shower, she loved it so much she requested this recipe be used for her wedding cake as well! I was honored and glad I could give her a delicious, moist, fluffy cake to enjoy with her new husband on their wedding day. I paired this recipe with a simple chocolate buttercream.",
