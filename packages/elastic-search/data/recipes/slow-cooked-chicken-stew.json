    "summary": "Slow cookers are so great for those times when you want a fuss-free dinner. You can literally throw everything in it and leave it all day so you have a lovely wholesome meal waiting for you at dinner time. We left this stew in the slow cooker for 8 hours on a low heat but if you want it ready bit sooner than that, you can turn the heat up to medium and it should be ready in about 4 hours.",
