    "summary": "Spiedies are the pride and joy of the Greater Binghamton area of N.Y.  They are such an important part of life there that the biggest party of the year celebrates them - The Spiedie Festival and Balloon Rally brings thousands into the area every summer.  Chunks of chicken (my favorite), pork, lamb (traditional) or venison are marinated in a mixture of oil, vinegar and herbs for 1 to 3 days, skewered, grilled and served on Italian bread with no condiments.",
