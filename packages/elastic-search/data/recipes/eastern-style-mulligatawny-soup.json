    "summary": "This is the recipe from Shalimar Restaurant in Albany, NY. It is amazing. Enjoy this soup with some vegetable samosas and cheese naan bread. As with most soups, the longer you cook it, the more flavorful it is. Also, this soup is better when its a little thicker rather than watery.",
