    "summary": "I'm fortunate to live in an area where I can buy fresh Cuban bread from Cuban bakeries. The loaf typically is about 36 inches long, which makes four big sandwiches. Cuban bread has a palmetto leaf placed on top center prior to baking to keep moisture in. The texture is crispy on the outside and very light on the inside.",
