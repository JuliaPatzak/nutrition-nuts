    "summary": "My friend Liz shared a similar caramel pumpkin blondie recipe years ago, and I've made it dozens of times with various tweaks. This is my favorite version, even though the caramel makes it sticky and messy it's totally worth it. It's forgiving, so feel free to alter and experiment! Store in an airtight container.",
