    "summary": "Getting ready to take a family vacation to the beach? Kickstart the kiddos' enthusiasm by serving them an ocean-themed lunch. It's a good way to sneak in some spinach (seaweed) to boot. Get creative with the rest of the bento by using baked fish crackers, grapes for sea pebbles, seaweed chips, all things ocean related cookie cutters including fish, turtle, shark, star for starfish, lobster, etc.  for other items to go in the box. Don't forget that special sweet treat. I used gummy octopus but Swedish fish and gummy worms would work well too.",
