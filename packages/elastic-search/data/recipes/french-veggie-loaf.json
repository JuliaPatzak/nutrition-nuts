    "summary": "I found this savory loaf recipe in the Alsace region of France. It is wonderfully moist, and because of the density of the veggie mixture, it doesn't rise too much. So be sure to pour all of the batter into the pan.  You can add or substitute other veggies of your choice. And enjoy!",
