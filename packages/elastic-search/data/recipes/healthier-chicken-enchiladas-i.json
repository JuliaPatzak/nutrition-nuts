    "summary": "I've always liked this recipe because it is quick and easy. I'm always looking for ways to cut out excess fat so I use reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. I also like to add fiber to make the meal a little healthier for my family so I add black beans and some bell peppers. This also adds color! To make it super healthy I use whole-wheat flour tortillas. And it still tastes just as delicious!",
