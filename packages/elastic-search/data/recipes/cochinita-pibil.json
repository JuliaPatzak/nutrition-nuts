    "summary": "This is my favorite Mexican pork dish that is always a hit.  Can be toned down with less or no peppers and still tastes awesome.  If you can find Seville orange juice, use it in place of the lemon and regular orange juice for authentic Mexican flavor. Quite easy to prepare too!  Your whole family will love this famous Mexican dish!",
