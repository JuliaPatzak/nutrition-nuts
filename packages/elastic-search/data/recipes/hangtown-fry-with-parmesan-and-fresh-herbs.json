    "summary": "My variation on the traditional Hangtown Fry contains cheese and fresh herbs and is finished under the broiler where the egg/oyster mixture puffs up like a cross between a frittata and a souffle. I get the best results using a cast iron skillet. It's important that the oven be hot before you place the skillet under the broiler.",
