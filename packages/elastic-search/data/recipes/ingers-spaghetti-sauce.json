    "summary": "My family loves this spaghetti sauce. I know once you view the ingredients you will say, 'Chicken bouillon and chicken seasoning?' Yup! Trust me, you will enjoy this recipe. The secret to making spaghetti sauce is to let it simmer. When finished you can either serve with spaghetti or add to ground beef for meat sauce. You can also let this cool off and refrigerate it in containers for future use.",
