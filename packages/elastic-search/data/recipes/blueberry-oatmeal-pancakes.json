    "summary": "I'm trying to eat less flour, but I also insist that my meals be tasty. After trying dozens of other people's recipes, I took ideas from all of them to create this. It's probably the most delicious thing I've ever had! By substituting out the eggs, it's easy to turn this into a vegan meal as well. Try a bite before topping with syrup, it's decadently yummy as-is! I make 'silver dollar' pancakes to take as snacks to potlucks.",
