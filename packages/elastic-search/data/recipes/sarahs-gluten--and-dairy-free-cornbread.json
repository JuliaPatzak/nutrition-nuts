    "summary": "A friend showed me this recipe, which her father used when she was forced to eat gluten free. This is one of the easiest and best-tasting gluten-free recipes around. If you forget to mention it to those that are not gluten free-they will never know! Success! I have also used this for cornbread stuffing around the holidays, and it is always a favorite!",
