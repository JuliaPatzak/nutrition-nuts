    "summary": "This warm, mild, creamy fondue is simple to make but tastes like you spent a lot more time on it. Delicious with bread cubes, vegetables, or even little meatballs. It's a great base recipe to put your own personal twist on with other cheeses or seasonings. Experiment with the types of cheese you like in this; it's great with Asiago, Romano, or even a little sharp Cheddar. For an extra kick, add a touch of cayenne pepper or hot sauce.",
