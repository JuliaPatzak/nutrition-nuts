    "summary": "Crunchy catfish nuggets that can be served as hors d'oeuvres. These were a special hit with my 3 year old who loved the fact that she could eat them like finger food. You may want to adjust the seasoning - my daughter is used to spicy stuff! These have the great taste of fried fish without the grease.",
