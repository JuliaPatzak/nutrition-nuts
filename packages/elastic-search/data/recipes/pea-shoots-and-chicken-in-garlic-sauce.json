    "summary": "Whenever we go out for Chinese food, my friends always order this vegetable dish from the 'secret' menu. It is so yummy and different and probably pretty good for you because it is as green as spinach. I've been scouring the vegetable aisle for months trying to figure out what exactly the stuff is. Lo and behold, today I found it at Superstore. Of course I didn't know exactly until I actually cooked it, but there was no mistaking it. They are snow pea shoots! Yumm yumm!",
