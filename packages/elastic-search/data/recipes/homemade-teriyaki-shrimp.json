    "summary": "If you want to serve this dish on rice, you need to start the rice first, because it comes together quickly! I used coconut aminos, a sub for soy sauce, that is a bit thinner in consistency and sweeter in taste than soy sauce. Sweet and full of umami, this recipe works as a light lunch, or as a main, with some steamed broccoli or a salad as a side.",
