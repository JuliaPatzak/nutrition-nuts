    "summary": "This recipe is very quick and easy to make.  I have a donut pan, which is like a muffin pan, but has donut shaped holes rather than muffin shaped holes. These donuts are baked not fried, so they don't have so many calories. I mix up either a powdered sugar glaze or a chocolate icing to top these with. They can also be rolled in cinnamon and white sugar, but it doesn't stick very well. My husband likes them just plain. For a chocolate glaze, simply stir 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips into the glaze mixture.",
