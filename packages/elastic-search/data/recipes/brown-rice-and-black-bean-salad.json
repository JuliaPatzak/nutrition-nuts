    "summary": "This is one of our summer staples. It goes together quickly and easily; it's good for you and yummy. It's also very versatile. The first night it's a stand-alone salad; the second night, heat a portion in a pan with an additional canned veggie and it's a side dish. If you have a favorite veggie, add that; if you hate corn, leave it out. Have fun and eat without guilt!",
