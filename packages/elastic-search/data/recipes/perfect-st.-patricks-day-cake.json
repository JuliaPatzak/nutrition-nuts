        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Line 2 9-inch cake pans with parchment paper, and spray with cooking spray",
        "Pour the beer into a saucepan, add the butter, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat",
        "Remove the pan from the heat, and whisk in the cocoa powder until the mixture is smooth",
        "Allow the mixture to cool",
        "In a bowl, beat the eggs and sour cream together until smooth with an electric mixer, and stir in the stout mixture to make a smooth, thick liquid",

        "Pour the stout mixture into the flour mixture, and gently combine with a spatula",

        "Place the chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl",
        "Bring cream to almost boiling in a small saucepan, and pour over the chocolate",
        "Stir in the butter, and stir the mixture until the chocolate melts and the mixture is very smooth",
        "Allow to cool until the mixture is pourable but not thin or overly runny, 10 to 15 minutes",
        "Stack a cake gently on top of the other, frosting sides uppermost, and carefully drizzle the chocolate mixture over the cake, allowing decorative drips to run down the sides"
