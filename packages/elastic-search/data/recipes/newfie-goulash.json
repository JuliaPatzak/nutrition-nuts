    "summary": "This is an old recipe, made by my grandmother who lived on an island in the North Atlantic, long before 'goulash' was made with ground beef. It was our typical meal when Mom was rushed to put something hot and tasty on the table. My family and friends use it lots, and I add the grated Parmesan on top to give it a gourmet touch. Nice with a green salad.",
