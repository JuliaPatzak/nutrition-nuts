    "summary": "I wanted s'mores one evening and I didn't want to build a fire. This is one of my now favorite recipes. It takes a little more time but it's not messy and great for little kids. Don't have to worry about cleaning their hands, might have to clean around their mouth though, if you have one of those children that could make a mess out of absolutely nothing. I was one of those children and still am today.",
