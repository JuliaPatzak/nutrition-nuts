    "summary": "I recently visited a fancy restaurant that served Parmesan encrusted pine nuts in their Caesar salad. This is my near-perfect attempt to replicate these delicious salad toppers. The salad consisted of romaine lettuce, shredded Parmesan cheese, dressing, mixed croutons, and these pine nuts. They are sweet, savory, nutty, and delicious.",
