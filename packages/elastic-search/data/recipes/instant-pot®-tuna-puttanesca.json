    "summary": "\"Nana's Tuna Puttanesca Sauce with Spaghetti Pasta\" by Diana71 has long been a favorite dish of mine, and one I regularly turned to when I had canned tuna, but this time when the craving hit, I only had frozen tuna steak. Instant Pot\u00ae to the rescue! I chose to cook my pasta separately from the sauce. Serve with crusty bread, if desired.",
