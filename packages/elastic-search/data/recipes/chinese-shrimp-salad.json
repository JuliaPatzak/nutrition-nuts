    "summary": "I had this dish at a wedding banquet and it was very good. The sweet lychee nicely compliments the apples and shrimp.  I have also tried this dish with potatoes instead of apples, it's not as sweet, or try it with both. Great for light summer dinner, or as a surprising potluck dish.",
