    "summary": "In Asia, there are different kinds of 'noodle soup'.  Noodle soup is more a noodle dish rather than a soup dish.  This one is a great comfort food on a cold day.  Light and healthy as well. Quantities are arbitrary.  Adjust to own taste. Very important to add the shallots as they give the fragrance and flavor.  Instead of egg noodles, sometimes I use macaroni.   You can also use soy sauce instead of the salt.  If you are adventurous, eat with chopped hot chile pepper or add some cayenne pepper to make the soup spicy.",
