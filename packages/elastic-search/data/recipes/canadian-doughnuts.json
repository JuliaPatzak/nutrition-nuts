    "summary": "If you ever visited Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in the winter months on the Rideau Canal, which is the longest skating rink in the world, they serve 'Beaver Tails,' a sweet pastry that is essentially a flat doughnut with sugar on top. I could not get the authentic recipe since it is their trade secret, but I created a replica of what they serve.",
