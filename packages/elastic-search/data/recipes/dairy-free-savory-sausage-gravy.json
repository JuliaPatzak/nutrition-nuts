    "summary": "Fairly basic, large-batch sausage gravy recipe that I've developed over time. The family loves it every time, so the large batch is needed! Normally I'd use soy milk for most things, but I've found that in greater quantities it tends to froth badly. Almond milk does not have this problem though! Serve over warmed biscuits or toasted bread of your choice.",
