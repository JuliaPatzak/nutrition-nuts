    "summary": "This dish is so easy to make, but tastes like you slaved away in the kitchen. When purchasing the scallops, be sure to look for a subtle pink or creme color. Stark white scallops have been soaked in water to add extra weight. Other pastas such as rotini, shells, or penne can be substituted for the farfalle. Makes an excellent main course, or add spinach or asparagus to turn it into a meal in itself. My pookie likes to have this dish served with antipasto of buffalo mozzarella, artichoke hearts, and fire roasted tomatoes.",
