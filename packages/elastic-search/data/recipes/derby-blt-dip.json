    "summary": "We were down in Kentucky to meet my niece's fiance and his friends and family and found this dip. Thought I'd pass it on. Can be served with veggies, but I liked it best with Triscuits\u00ae. I was surprised by this dip. I only tried it because of the crackers. For better flavor, make the day before so the flavors can meld. Can also be made by leaving out bacon and adding 1/2 cup slivered almonds or finely chopped pecans.",
