    "summary": "This is an all-purpose injection to add to any pork loin, butt, or shoulder meat. You can adjust the measurement amounts to your liking. Keep in mind that pork tends to be a saltier type of meat by itself. Inject into the pork of your choice using a flavor injector tool, and then place the pork in the fridge for 12 hours or overnight. Prepare and cook, smoke, or grill pork to your liking.",
