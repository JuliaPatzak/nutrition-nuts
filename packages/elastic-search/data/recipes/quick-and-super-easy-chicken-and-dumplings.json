    "summary": "This is a great recipe for Southern-style chicken and dumplings. My husband doesn't usually like chicken and dumplings, but he absolutely loved these and asked for seconds (which he never does with anything). My little boys (2, 4, and 5 years) ate it up and asked for more also. I just threw this together on a night I didn't feel like spending much time and energy on cooking. This is great and easy for the kids to help with also.",
