        "Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar over 1/2 cup of warm water in a small bowl",
        "The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C)",
        "Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam",
        "Add milk, shortening, eggs, oil, 3 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt",
        "Blend with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth",
        "Mix in remaining 3 cups of flour by hand, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition",
        "When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes",
        "The dough will be sticky",
        "Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil",

        "Set each formed bun aside",
        "Mix the baking soda and 4 cups hot water in a bowl",
        "The baking soda does not need to dissolve completely",
        "Dip each bun in the baking soda solution before placing on a baking sheet",

        "Bake in the preheated oven until brown, 20 to 25 minutes",
