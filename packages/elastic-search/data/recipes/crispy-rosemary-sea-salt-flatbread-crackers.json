    "ingredients": [
        "1\u2009\u00bd cups all-purpose flour",
        "1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt",
        "1 teaspoon white sugar",
        "\u00bd cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese",
        "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
        "\u00bd cup cold water",
        "1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Line a baking sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper",
        "Place flour, salt, sugar, and grated cheese in a mixing bowl",
        "Stir together until well mixed",
        "Add rosemary; drizzle with olive oil and add water",
        "Mix with a fork until mixture comes together in a fairly sticky dough and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 3 to 5 minutes",
        "Transfer dough onto floured surface and add flour as you knead the dough",
        "Knead until it no longer sticks to work surface, 4 to 5 minutes",
        "Divide dough in half",
        "Dust work surface with flour",
        "Roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness or less",
        "Brush or mist surface of dough very lightly with water",
        "Sprinkle with coarse sea salt",
        "Prick the entire surface of dough with the tines of a fork to prevent crackers from puffing too much when baking",
        "Cut each rolled out half into about 30 pieces with a pizza wheel",
        "You can cut them out in squares, rectangles, or triangles--your choice",
        "Transfer onto prepared baking sheet with a bench scraper or your floured fingers (dough will be very sticky)",
        "Bake in preheated oven until perfectly browned and crunchy, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness"
