    "summary": "Moist, flavorful and absolutely one of the best meat loaf recipes yet!  Using a large muffin pan allows the mini meat muffins to cook faster and makes portion sizing easier. I like to serve this with sweet potatoes or butternut squash.  I think the mini meat loaves taste great the next day as they are easy to put away and re-heat.  Try making a meat loaf sandwich out of them too.",
