    "summary": "My family prefers the store brand of Italian dressing to any of the name brands. They all pretty much taste the same and have the same ingredients. This is a copycat of their dressing using mostly ingredients from the cabinet most people keep on hand or can find easily.  The water makes it stretch a little further for those on a tight budget, but you might also like it without.",
