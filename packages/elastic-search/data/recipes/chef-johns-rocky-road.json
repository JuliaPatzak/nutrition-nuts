    "summary": "I thought I was gonna show you how to make a famous candy, based on a famous ice cream, but as it turns out, it's actually the other way around. The ice cream flavor was inspired by an Australian candy that goes by the same name, which used the same signature ingredients--chocolate, marshmallows, and nuts. Regardless, this is super easy to make, and would be an absolutely wonderful edible gift for the upcoming holidays. Keep unused portions in the fridge.",
