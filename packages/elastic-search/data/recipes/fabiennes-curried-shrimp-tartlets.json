    "summary": "This little tartlet stemmed from my frustration trying to make \"phyllo purses.\" Perfect appetizer before a fancy dinner or brunch with your friends. It's bursting with shrimp, curry, sun-dried tomatoes, green onions, ginger, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and topped with an egg...all hidden under the last sheets of phyllo dough. Well worth your time!",
