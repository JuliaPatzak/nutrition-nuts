    "summary": "My sister gave me this recipe years ago and it has become a staple of our holiday or 'company is coming' type of dinner. It's easy to assemble and can be prepared ahead of time. It pairs well with beef, ham, or chicken. Leftovers, if there are any, reheat well. Everyone always loves 'The Irish Potatoes.' Yes, I know 'The Irish Potatoes' are fattening, but without the butter, whipping cream, and half and half it is just not as good. Substituting margarine or frozen hash browns would be a travesty.",
