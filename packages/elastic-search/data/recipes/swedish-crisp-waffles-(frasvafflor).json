    "summary": "Waffles are a very popular street food and coffee shop item in Sweden. We also eat them specifically on the Feast of the Annunciation because \u201cV\u00e5rfrudagen\u201d (Lady Day in Swedish) sounded a lot like \u201cv\u00e5ffeldagen\u201d, thus became Waffle Day! These are a lot crisper and lighter than American and Belgian waffles and contain no eggs. Serve immediately with whipped cream and fresh fruit or jam.",
