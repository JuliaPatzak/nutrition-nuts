    "summary": "This recipe is from years of searching for the perfect English tea sandwich. I always looked forward to tea time in the Caribbean with my grandparents who were from English descent. My grandmother was French and my grandfather was from Guyana. My grandfather's parents were from England, so there is the British influence. You can add a teaspoon of dill to your spread.",
