    "summary": "Bold flavors in a very light sauce: substantial and satisfying, good warm-weather alternative to spaghetti bolognese. You might think the sauce too thin the first time you make it (almost a thick broth), but it will be full of flavor. Quantities of tuna, sun-dried tomato, and artichoke are variable to preference, just be sure to provide an overall robust combination, always mindful of potential saltiness (esp. regarding the sun-dried tomatoes). Also, fresh oregano or lemon thyme could be substituted for thyme. This should go without saying: please don't put any cheese on this pasta.",
