    "summary": "Chef Mario Hevia developed this Asian twist on an American classic in a quest to bring together contrasting flavors and textures of sweet and salty, tender and crunchy. And, of course, with gooey cheese on top. He melts the cheese directly in the pan before laying it on top of the sandwich fillings, making it extra gooey.",
