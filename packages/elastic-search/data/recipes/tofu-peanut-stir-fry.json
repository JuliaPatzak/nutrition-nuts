    "summary": "This is absolutely the best way to eat tofu, especially for first timers. The tofu has a slightly crunchy exterior while the inside is nice and soft. I used to make my stir-fry with chicken or beef, but my husband won't have it any other way than tofu now! And my 2 year old loves it! It is a delicious, easy, quick, and inexpensive meal. Serve with Asian noodles or with steamed rice. Enjoy!",
