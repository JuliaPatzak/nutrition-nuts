    "summary": "This fast-and-easy dish was an instant success at my house, even in my fish-hesitant family. The panko crisps up beautifully, and the halibut is tender, moist, and delicately-flavored. This was inspired, in part, by several Weight Watchers\u00ae recipes; I don't know the calories or points exactly, but it's a very simple lean and low-calorie dinner. It pairs well with roasted or stuffed tomatoes (can cook at the same temperature!) and a salad. Serve with lemon wedges.",
