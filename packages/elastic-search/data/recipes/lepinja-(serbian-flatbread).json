    "ingredients": [
        "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast",
        "2 tablespoons warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)",
        "1 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees F)",
        "1 tablespoon white sugar",
        "2\u2009\u2153 cups all-purpose flour",
        "1 teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk in a small bowl",
        "Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam",
        "Stir the warm water and sugar into the yeast mixture",
        "Stir the flour and salt together in a separate bowl; add all but about 1/2 cup of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture; mix with your hands until a soft dough forms, adding the last of the flour mixture a little at a time until it clears the sides of the bowl",
        "Cover the bowl with a light cloth and let  the dough rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour",
        "Deflate, or 'punch down,' the dough and turn out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour; knead for about 5 minutes",
        "Return the dough to the bowl, cover again with a light cloth, and allow the dough to again rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes more",
        "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Lightly grease a baking sheet",
        "Deflate the dough and turn turn out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour; knead lightly",
        "Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet; shape into an oval about 1/2-inch thick",
        "Set aside to rise a third time for about 30 minutes",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned and hollow sounding when thumped, 20 to 25 minutes"
