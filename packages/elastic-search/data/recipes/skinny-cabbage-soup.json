    "summary": "Many credit soup for being their weight loss secret. I intended to make a skinny soup that could aid by filling me up so I would eat less of my main course. Well, this soup has evolved so much, I don't even eat the main course. So incredibly hearty, wholesome, and filling! It's a beautiful soup with many colors and also freezes well. I hope you enjoy. I would love to know of any modifications so I can try that next time.",
