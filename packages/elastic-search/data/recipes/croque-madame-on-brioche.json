    "summary": "A spin on the traditional French croque monsieur with deli ham, rich smoky cheese, b\u00e9chamel, and eggs on brioche bread. Typically in France the eggs are fried but I prefer poached eggs topped with chives and smoked paprika. Optionally serve it with sliced plum tomatoes to make it a croque Proven\u00e7al. This is my sweet angel's favorite dish that I prepare for her.",
