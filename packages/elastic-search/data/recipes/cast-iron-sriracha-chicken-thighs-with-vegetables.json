        "Whisk honey, soy sauce, Sriracha, lime juice, garlic, and pepper for marinade together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag",
        "Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag",

        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess",

        "Melt butter in a large, cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat",
        "Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes; this will melt out most of the fat underneath and leave a nice, crispy skin",

        "Drain extra fat and oil from the skillet",

        "Meanwhile, mix Sriracha, brown sugar, honey, and jalapeno in a small bowl until smooth",
        "Remove skillet from the heat",
        "Return chicken to the skillet, skin-side up",
        "Pour Sriracha mixture primarily onto the chicken, and a bit onto the vegetables",
        "Place the skillet in the preheated oven and roast until potatoes are tender and chicken is completely cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes",
        "An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)",
        "Garnish with green onion and serve"
