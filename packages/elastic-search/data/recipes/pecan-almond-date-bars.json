    "summary": "I needed something perfect for skiing and hiking; something compact, healthy, and most of all, delicious. This is it! I brought this along to a hike with my friends, and everyone asked for the recipe. It's perfect for air travel or any sport. You can use other nuts and you can add other dried fruits, but always use at least a full cup of dates. When cool, cut into 18 little squares.",
