    "summary": "A great salad for summer days, cool, crunchy and refreshingly light. The chicken breasts are preferably barbecued for extra flavor, but baked is ok too. I also often double this recipe and make 3 times the dressing and there is always great lunch leftovers remaining. People also love the dressing so more typically goes onto the salad when you let them self serve than would normally, and that's ok, it makes it very flavorful. You can also crush up the ramen not used when making the dressing, and top the salad with these as well.  I prefer them without.",
