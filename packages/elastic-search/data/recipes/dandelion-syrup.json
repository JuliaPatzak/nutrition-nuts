    "summary": "It has taken me years to perfect my dandelion syrup. Only use the yellow part of the dandelion blossoms, otherwise the syrup will taste bitter. I also try to use as little sugar as possible otherwise it only tastes sweet. It's a great honey substitute for vegans. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.",
