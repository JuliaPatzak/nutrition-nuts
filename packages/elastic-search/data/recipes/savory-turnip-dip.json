    "summary": "I stumbled upon this recipe when I was both desperate for some dip and looking for a way to use up some frozen turnip greens I had in the freezer. I am not normally a huge turnip fan, but this recipe is so incredibly delicious, I even prefer it to spinach dip. I make this recipe with beef soujouk (beef sausage) from the Middle Eastern foods store instead of bacon because of a pork allergy, but it tastes great either way.",
