    "summary": "These biscuits have an amazing aroma and taste that will turn any grump into a jolly lad!  They are crispy on the outside, yet soft and puffy in the center.  They freeze well too, for making large batches. This recipe is best when hand made, so try not to be tempted by your mixers. Trust me, it will pay off in the end.  Buy block cheese and grate it by hand for best quality.  I use a medium size grate.  I do NOT recommend using fine grated cheeses.",
