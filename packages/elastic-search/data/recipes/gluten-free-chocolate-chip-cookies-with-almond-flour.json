    "summary": "These chocolate chip cookies are made with almond flour and are therefore gluten free. However, they taste so good, I would put them up against any cookie recipe out there, and they'd probably win. The texture is slightly crispy on the outside and moist and chewy in the middle. Nobody that I have baked these for has been able to eat just one.",
