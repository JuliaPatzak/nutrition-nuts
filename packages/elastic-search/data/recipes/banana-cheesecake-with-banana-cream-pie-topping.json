    "summary": "This simple recipe is a combination of banana cheesecake and banana cream pie all rolled into one dessert! It uses an Oreo\u00ae-cookie crust instead of the traditional graham cracker crust, adding a bit of a chocolate accent. Plus, it uses fat-free cream cheese, but proves to taste rich and creamy for a banana-y treat! Garnish with whipped cream and sliced bananas, if desired.",
