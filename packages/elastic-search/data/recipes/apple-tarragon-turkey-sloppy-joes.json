    "summary": "A more wholesome version of the ever-popular sloppy joe using ground turkey instead of ground beef. You'll get sweetness from the apples, a subtle hint of anise from the tarragon, and a burst of aromatic flavor from the cloves. Be adventuresome, step outside the box, and give it a try! Serve on butter-toasted hamburger buns.",
