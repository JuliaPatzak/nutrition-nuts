    "summary": "I was a young boy on 4-H in California and when it came time to do my first demonstration I chose my first love....cooking! This recipe is great for kids' taste buds, but can be 'Mitch'ed' up, as my wife would call it, to suit the more refined taste buds of the adults in the house. Serve on a paper plate with favorite potato chips or have Mom make your favorite macaroni or potato salad.",
