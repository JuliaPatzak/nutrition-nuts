    "summary": "This recipe comes from my favorite cookbook from a church. It is simple, easy, inexpensive and delicious! Not to mention it tastes better than the vanilla wafers you can buy at the store! You can make the cookies bigger if you'd like, they just won't have as crispy of an outside. We like to add a slice of banana between two cookies, dip them in chocolate, and then freeze them (;",
