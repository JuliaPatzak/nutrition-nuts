    "summary": "A recipe handed down by my grandmother Anna Marie McNamara (nee Player). This is a great recipe for a light tea dessert bread. Delicious with light butter hot out of the oven. You can use any type of milk. I usually make this bread when my milk is about to go sour. I like to use raw crystallized sugar in place of the white granulated sugar. My father likes to use buttermilk.",
