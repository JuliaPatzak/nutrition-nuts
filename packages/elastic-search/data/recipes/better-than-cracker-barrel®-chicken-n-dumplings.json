    "summary": "My Grandma grew up on a farm and this was her recipe - no shortcuts but still pretty easy.  For best results you must use a whole chicken and flour. You can also use some chicken stock for added flavor. The trick is the lemon which makes the chicken tender and adds flavor to the soup. Leftovers won't last very long with this.",
