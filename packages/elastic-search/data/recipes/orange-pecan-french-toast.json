    "summary": "My husband and I were vacationing recently and had this lovely French toast at a bed and breakfast.  When we came back home, I kept missing it so I called them up and requested it.  They actually gave me the recipe over the phone!  I generally halve the recipe for my husband and I, and bake it in an 8 inch square pan.  Reheats well in the toaster oven.  I served it to my in-laws recently and they loved it. Serve with a little sweetened whipped cream and berries!",
