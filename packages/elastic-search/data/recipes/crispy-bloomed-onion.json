    "summary": "If nachos and French onion soup had a baby, it'd be this no-fry version of Outback's famous 'Bloomin' Onion.' Though easier to make and way less messy, it tastes every bit as good. Maybe better, since every bite is cooked perfectly crispy. This came out so well, I didn't even think about making a sauce, but anything that pairs well with onions would be good scattered over top of these 'onion nachos.'",
