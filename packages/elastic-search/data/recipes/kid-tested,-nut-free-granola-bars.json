    "summary": "Easy granola bars that do not get sticky or fall apart when packed in a lunchbox. Lots of nutrition has been snuck into a bar that is as appealing to kids as to their health-conscious caregivers. I like to store most of them in the freezer and just pull out a few at a time to thaw.",
