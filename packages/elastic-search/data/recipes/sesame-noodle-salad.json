    "summary": "This amazing salad recipe was given to me by a friend who used to know someone at the now closed Larry's Markets in the Seattle area.  I've added to the recipe a little -- so it's not exactly the same... but better! I take this to every picnic and everyone loves it! May also add diced chicken for a variation.",
