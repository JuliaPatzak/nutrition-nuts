    "summary": "Serve these eggplant stacks as an elegant appetizer, for lunch, or even as a light dinner. There are many variations out there, most of them Italian-inspired. They usually include tomato sauce, basil, and provolone or mozzarella cheese. The Greek flavors in this version got great reviews from my family. The simple and healthy dish is a combination of classic Mediterranean ingredients such as eggplant, ripe tomatoes, oregano, mint, and Greek Kasseri cheese. Serve it with olives, hot pita bread, and maybe some Greek yogurt on the side.",
