    "summary": "If you're tired of a BLT, try a BBPT. The basil pesto is a wonderful complement to the bacon and tomato on this sandwich. During summer, when you have more basil than you know what to do with, make your own pesto. You can freeze pesto in ice cube trays for a real treat in the winter. And go ahead and pick one of those fresh tomatoes in your garden to slice down for this sandwich.",
