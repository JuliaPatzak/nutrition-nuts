    "summary": "An incredibly simple summertime soup for all that extra zucchini from the garden. This soup is delicately spicy, full of flavor, yet low in fat and calories. Butter or oil can be omitted if using a non-stick pan. This is also a great soup to use for canning or freezing so you can enjoy the tastes of summer during the winter months!",
