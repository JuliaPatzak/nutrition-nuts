    "summary": "Artisan coleslaw has become a passion of mine recently. Celery root adds a unique taste and a plethora of health benefits. As does the apple cider vinaigrette, making this a great choice when watching the waist line. The longer the slaw sits, the more the flavors have time to deepen - it's really good when left in the fridge overnight, and makes great leftovers!",
