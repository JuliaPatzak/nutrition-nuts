    "summary": "I love this dish! It reminds me of potlucks and summertime. It's full of every texture--warm, cool, crisp, soft, crunchy. It has a touch of sweetness and tanginess from the dressing, and the lovely nacho cheese flavor from the chips, with the taco-seasoned meat. It all works together deliciously and is a quick and easy meal that's ready to go anytime.",
