    "summary": "A wonderful oven-roasted BBQ pulled pork made with about any pork roast in a Dutch oven. Low and slow roasting up above the juices is the key. Serve by itself or on buns. I like mine with coleslaw and a root beer-BBQ sauce on multi-grain buns. Baked beans are a nice side dish, too.",
