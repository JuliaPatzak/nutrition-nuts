    "summary": "I was looking for a lower-calorie way to make my husband's favorite summer side dish, as my traditional potato salad was laden with eggs and mayo! The tzatziki dip as dressing certainly did the trick! The tarragon in the onions gives that hint of 'what is that?' to this recipe! Can be served warm or chilled.",
