    "summary": "After years of adjusting, learning from failures, and sorting through advice from others that turned out to be good or bad, I finally have a great recipe that people flip over. The two biggest tips I've learned in making these is to heat the milk and butter before mashing in, and to use a hand masher as opposed to an electric mixer. Using these methods, I have NEVER had the potatoes come out pasty or soupy, always super-fluffy with just enough body.",
