    "summary": "My favorite way to dazzle in a hurry, these shrimp take minutes to make. Full of flavor, they take the center stage at any meal, but I am also known to throw them in a fresh garden salad as well. I do tend to always use the largest shrimp I can get my hands on, they seem to have the best flavor to them! Once complete, feel free to serve immediately over pasta, with warm crusty bread and a garden salad, or with a rice dish. This one compliments them all!",
