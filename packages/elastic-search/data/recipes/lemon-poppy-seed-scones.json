    "summary": "The method for making these scones is very simple but can be a little scary for a novice baker, since the dough starts off in such rough shape. If you're able to wrestle it all together on the table, verses mixing into a dough ball in the bowl, you'll be rewarded with a much tenderer scone. But even a slightly tough one, painted with a fruity fresh strawberry glaze, will be a winner at any special-occasion brunch or teatime.",
