    "summary": "As flavorful as you want to make it, this comes together easily and is wonderful for a lazy Sunday, or make them ahead and freeze them. Pop them in the toaster for a hot and tasty breakfast treat you can eat on the go. Easily scalable recipe, and you can sub cauliflower and/or broccoli for a healthier base ingredient. These freeze well and make for a great grab-and-go breakfast snack that you can eat with your hand--holds together well, and isn't greasy! Microwave will not give you the crispy exterior on reheating.",
