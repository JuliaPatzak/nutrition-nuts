        "Season salmon fillets with salt and black pepper and set aside for about 5 minutes; pat off any excess moisture with paper towels",

        "Stir 2 tablespoons butter, parsley, and basil into the cooked pasta until coated; sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste",

        "Allow to simmer for about 3 minutes to blend flavors",
        "To serve, divide angel hair pasta between two plates, top each serving of pasta with half the asparagus and pecans, and arrange a fillet over the asparagus",
        "Spoon Dijon dressing over fillets to serve"
