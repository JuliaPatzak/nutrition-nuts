    "summary": "Broccoli rabe, also called rapini, is known for its slightly bitter and peppery taste. Blanching it before grilling helps tone down the bitterness. Squeeze lemon wedged over top when serving, if desired. It is excellent served alongside grilled Italian sausages and thick crusty bread.",
