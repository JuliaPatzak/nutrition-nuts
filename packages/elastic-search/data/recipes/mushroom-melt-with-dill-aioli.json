    "summary": "I love this as a fancy alternative to plain grilled cheese, and the aioli is an instant hit. Spread the sauce on top of the bread for a messier, fork-needed meal. You'll have enough aioli for a second sandwich; it will harden in the fridge due to the olive oil, but softens quickly. It really only lasts a day.",
