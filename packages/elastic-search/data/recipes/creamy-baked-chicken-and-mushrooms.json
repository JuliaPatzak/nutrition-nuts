    "summary": "This is a simple and tasty recipe for weekdays or when friends and family come over to visit. It's a creamy chicken comfort food recipe with mushrooms that I have had a lot of good comments on when I make it at home. If you have a rice cooker, cook some rice while the chicken is resting. It's a great base for the chicken and creamy sauce.",
