    "summary": "Wanted to eat a chicken Parmesan sub but didn't feel like spending the time cooking and breading chicken. So I opted to cut corners using frozen chicken patties and pre-prepared ingredients to make my life easier. Picked up the sub rolls and couldn't justify eating that many calories, so opted instead for sliced Italian bread and thin-sliced cheese. Turned out so surprisingly good, I thought I'd share. Enjoy!",
