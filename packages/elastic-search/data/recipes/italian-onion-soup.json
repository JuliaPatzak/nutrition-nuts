    "summary": "I use this terrific, nourishing soup as a filling weeknight supper. Use any combination of onions you like, making it great all year long: yellow onions, red onions, leeks, shallots, cipolline, even green onions. And when it is cold outside, I caramelize the onions longer for deeper flavor.",
