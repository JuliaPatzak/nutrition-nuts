    "summary": "I was in the mood for some egg rolls and, when trying to think of something to go with them, I opened the fridge and saw way too many oranges. Not finding an orange sweet-and-sour sauce, I made my own. This is sweet and sour with a bit of spice and a beautiful, yet light, orange taste. Perfect over egg rolls, shrimp, chicken, rice, or even stir-fried veggies.",
