    "summary": "This is a recipe taught to my by my mother-in-law, Audry Falgout.  It has a great flavor and for being a South Louisiana recipe in well seasoned but not overly seasoned.  The darker you cook your roux, the deeper the flavor. This may seem like a long time to cook shrimp but it works. In our family it is typically served over hot cooked rice with potato salad on the side.",
