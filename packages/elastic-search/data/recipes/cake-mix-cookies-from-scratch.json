    "summary": "I have been intrigued by the cake mix cookie recipes published on Allrecipes and discussed in the Recipe Exchange. Between that, and the recurring requests in the Exchange for cookies that don't go flat, and people either unwilling or unable to use boxed cake mix, I was inspired to come up with this recipe. The basic recipe is for chocolate chip cookies. It is easily adaptable and can be customized to your liking.",
