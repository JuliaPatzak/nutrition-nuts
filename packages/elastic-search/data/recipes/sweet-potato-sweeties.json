    "summary": "I was looking for a healthier alternative to the chewy/crunchy/gooey/yummy part of traditional candied sweet potatoes and stumbled upon these. This low-sugar version of sweet potatoes (also known as a superfood for its high nutritional value) can be eaten as a side dish or snacked on straight out of the fridge (even better, I think). Great for kids, too.",
