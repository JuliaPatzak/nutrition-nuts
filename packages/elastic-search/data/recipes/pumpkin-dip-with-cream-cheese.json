    "summary": "My family asks for this pumpkin dip with cream cheese every year when autumn rolls around (or, actually, as soon as my husband can possibly make a case that it's even getting close to fall). We usually serve it with gingersnaps and sliced apples, and occasionally spread it over bagels for a morning treat.",
