    "summary": "This is an authentic Swedish pancake recipe that was taught to my father by his mother, who was born in Sweden. My father then passed it to me. Kids love them. Never any leftovers when I make them. To serve, you can spoon melted butter over pancakes and sprinkle with sugar, or serve with lingonberry sauce. You can also use the batter to make crepes.",
