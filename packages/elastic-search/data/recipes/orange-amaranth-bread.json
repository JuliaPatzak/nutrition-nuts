    "author": "LEYLEE24",
    "summary": "Made with a mix of white and wheat bread flours, amaranth flour, orange zest, and honey, this bread has a unique slightly sweet flavor and wonderful aroma. Suitable to make by hand or in your bread machine. I adapted this recipe from one I found online, while looking for bread recipes that use amaranth flour. Very good with butter and honey. Amaranth flour is available from Bob's Red Mill\u00ae. Stores that have a decent selection of natural foods or natural markets should stock it.",
