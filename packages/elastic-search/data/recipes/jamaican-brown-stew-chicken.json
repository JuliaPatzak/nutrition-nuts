    "summary": "I've been wanting to make this for a while since I love any kind of braised or stewed chicken recipes, especially ones that have similar ingredients as jerk chicken. While I might make a few adjustments next time, this really did come out amazingly well. Serve over steamed rice with green peas and garnish with fresh thyme.",

        "Make 2 slices into the skin side of each thigh, perpendicular to the bone, about 1 inch apart, cutting all the way down to the bone",
        "Add chicken thighs to the marinade and toss thoroughly until evenly coated",
        "Place a piece of plastic wrap over the chicken and transfer to the refrigerator, 12 hours or overnight",
        "If possible, toss several times during the marinating time",
        "Remove the chicken from the marinade",
        "Scrape off any chunks of marinade from chicken into the bowl and reserve for later",
        "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until almost smoking hot",

        "Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is tender and no longer pink in the centers, and the sauce has reduced and thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, skimming the excess fat that comes to the top and basting the chicken with the sauce occasionally",
        "Taste and adjust seasoning",
        "Toss in reserved sliced green onions",
        "Serve immediately"
