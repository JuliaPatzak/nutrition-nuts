    "summary": "Moist, lightly sweet biscuits are just perfect for breakfast or a cup of tea in the afternoon.  This is as close as I could get to the store bakery version. My husband and kids loved these just as much as the store bought biscuits.  We make a lactose free version with vanilla soy milk  and margarine, but have made the milk variety for others.  Recipe works perfectly in both options.",
