    "summary": "I came up with this coffee cake as a way to use up some leftover butternut squash puree. The cake itself is light, fluffy, and moist, with a crispy streusel topping providing a nice contrast. The flavor combo of the squash with the orange, poppy seeds, and spices turned out deliciously. Enjoy slightly warm, or at room temp. May even taste better the next day.",
