    "summary": "Sweet and spicy strips of pheasant. A great way to use pheasant or even duck and great on chicken too.  My kids request this recipe for their birthday dinners! We have a lot of hunters so are always needing recipes.  We've tried this with duck also and it's even good with duck (it's hard to make duck people will eat). Even people who claim to hate duck eat it.",
