    "summary": "My family wasn't that thrilled with the taste of turkey burgers and I was watching my intake of beef. I started experimenting with ground chicken in my burgers and was mildly surprised with the outcome. The family likes these better than beef burgers! I usually make this when I bring the chicken home from the market.  It makes for a quick meal on a weeknight. It just doesn't get any easier! These are served on Belle's\u00ae Hamburger Rolls which are totally off the hook!",
