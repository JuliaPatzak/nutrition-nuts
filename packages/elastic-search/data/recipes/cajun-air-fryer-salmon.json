    "summary": "Full of flavor with a hint of sweetness, this moist and delicious salmon is ready in under 10 minutes! You may want to add salt before serving if you are using an unsalted Cajun seasoning. I like to use a Misto\u00ae sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray. For best results, use center-cut fillets that are about an inch thick.",
