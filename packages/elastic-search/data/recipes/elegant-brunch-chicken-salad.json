    "summary": "I made this for a baby shower and was bombarded with requests for the recipe!  It is delicious on its own, or with small bread slices or crackers.  Don't skimp by not using the homemade mayonnaise, it really adds a special flavor!  Makes a 2-quart serving dish full, so if there will be other foods, this will serve at least six, maybe even up to ten!",

        "\u00bd teaspoon salt",
        "2 teaspoons hot water",

        "Add the oil a tablespoon at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition",

        "Stir until evenly coated, adding more mayonnaise if necessary",
