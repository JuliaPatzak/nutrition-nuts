    "summary": "This spoon cake is sort of a mix of a spoonbread, a pudding cake, and a biscuit all in one. It's then topped with delicious strawberries for an easy, home-style dessert. It's better to err on the side of under-baking this cake rather than over-baking, as it's meant to have a soft center. Serve it warm, with some vanilla ice cream, if desired.",
