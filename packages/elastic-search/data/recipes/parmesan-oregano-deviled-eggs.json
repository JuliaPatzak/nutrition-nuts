    "summary": "I've always marveled at how deviled egg recipes can be fiddled with and ingredients switched in and out, but they always still taste so good! I made this version last night for my fiance, and he loved the blend of sweetness and spiciness! These have oregano, Parmesan-Romano cheese, Dijon mustard, and a dash of hot sauce. I garnished them with a shredded Cheddar cheese blend and some paprika.",
