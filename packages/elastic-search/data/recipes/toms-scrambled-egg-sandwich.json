    "summary": "My dad came up with this recipe years ago. Over the years, everyone I have shared this with always reacts the same way. First, they tell me 'that sounds awful!' After they eat it their story changes to 'that was amazing!' I know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me; you'll love it. I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks; I just ask that you try it before changing it up.",
