        "1 teaspoon garlic salt",
        "1 cup tomato sauce",
        "1 cup sliced pepperoni",

        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)",
        "Use the oil to lightly grease the cups of two 12-cup muffin tins",
        "Take pizza dough and put enough in each cup to cover the bottom and 1/3 to 1/2 up the sides",
        "Sprinkle garlic salt over top, then spoon 1 tablespoon sauce onto each crust",
