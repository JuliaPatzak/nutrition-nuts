        "Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth, then whisk in the warm milk mixture and yeast",
        "Stir in the flour and margarine until a dough forms",
        "Turn out onto a floured work surface, and knead until smooth and satiny, 10 to 20 minutes",
        "Place the dough into a greased bowl, and turn over to grease both sides of the dough",
        "Cover, and set in a warm spot to rise until doubled, about 1 hour",
        "Punch dough down, and knead again briefly to push out the air",
        "Cover, and let rest 10 minutes",

        "Grease two baking sheets, and cut each roll into 12 pieces",
        "Arrange the cinnamon rolls onto the prepared baking sheets",
