    "summary": "I make lots of cream soups and this is a good 'basic' recipe. I originally made this in 1990 and always make some modifications - we like lots of garlic as reflected in this recipe!! I also add or substitute other vegetables, i.e., broccoli and spinach. I also use potatoes for thickening rather than cream to keep the fat down.",
