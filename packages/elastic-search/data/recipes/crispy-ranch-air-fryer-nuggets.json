    "summary": "These air fried nuggets are healthier than deep fried, and have tons of flavor! Serve with your favorite dipping sauce such as ranch, honey mustard, or chipotle mayo. I like to use a Misto\u00ae sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray. Use different varieties of ranch mix (spicy, dill, etc) to change up the flavor.",
