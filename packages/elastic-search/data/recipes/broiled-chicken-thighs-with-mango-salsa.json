    "summary": "With all the kitchen gadgets these days, it's easy to forget that your broiler can do a great job on boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Put the chicken thighs in the marinade early in the morning, and the broiler will have your dinner ready in about 10 minutes. Start the salsa ahead of time, so the bright flavors can meld, while you get the remainder of your dinner ready. Lime=cilantro rice makes a great side for this dish!",
