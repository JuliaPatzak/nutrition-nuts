    "summary": "Cheap and easy alternative to take out. Our kid loves ramen noodles, so this is a great way to make him eat his veggies without him even realizing it! You could make this with chicken, beef, or pork as well, just use the corresponding ramen soup flavor. I'm sure that a lot of people would also add sesame oil for more authentic flavor, but I find sesame oil overpowering (personal preference).",
