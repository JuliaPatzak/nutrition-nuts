    "summary": "I was running low on groceries and needed to use pantry staples to create a filling dinner for my family. I came up with this soup and now it's become a favorite in our home. For an even creamier consistency, I sometimes use a can of evaporated milk in place of the regular milk in the recipe. Leftover taco meat or shredded rotisserie chicken can be added to make it more hearty.",
