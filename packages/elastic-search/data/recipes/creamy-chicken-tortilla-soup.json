    "summary": "A restaurant in my town had the best creamy chicken tortilla soup, but they closed up and I have not been able to find a great tortilla soup since. I decided to create my own based on recipes that I had tried in the past. My husband couldn't get enough of it, so I knew it was a hit. Optional toppings: sour cream, shredded Cheddar, and avocado.",
