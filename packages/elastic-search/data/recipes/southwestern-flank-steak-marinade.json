    "summary": "Use for flank or skirt steak (or meat of choice). Make sure that all surfaces of the meat have contact with the marinade. Allow to marinate up to 2 hours; cook as desired. I generally grill a flank steak for sandwiches or tacos when I'm feeling the need for something fun. It's got a Southwestern flair to it, but is still agreeable enough for my 4-year-old's palate. Or build a sandwich or some fajitas with some grilled onions and roasted red peppers... Delicious!",
