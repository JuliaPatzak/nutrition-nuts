        "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",
        "4 large carrots, chopped",
        "5 stalks celery, chopped",
        "1 large onion, chopped",
        "8 cups water",
        "1 cup orzo",
        "3 large eggs",
        "2 medium lemons, juiced",

    "directions": [
        "Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium heat",
        "Add carrots, celery, and onion; cook until veggies soften and flavors have mingled, about 3 minutes",
        "Add water and bring to a boil",
        "Cook for at least 1 hour, or longer for a more flavorful broth",
        "Use a slotted spoon to transfer vegetable chunks to a food processor",
        "Blend until smooth and return to the pot",
        "Add orzo and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes",
        "Meanwhile, whip eggs in a bowl",
        "Add lemon juice",
        "Add a few tablespoons of hot broth to the lemon-egg mixture, whisking constantly to avoid curdling the eggs",
        "Continue until lemon-egg mixture is hot, then add to the broth",
        "Reduce heat and cook, without boiling, until soup thickens a bit, about 3 minutes",
        "Allow soup to cool slightly before serving; it will become even thicker",
        "Season with salt and pepper"
