    "summary": "My mother made this chocolate mousse cake for me once or twice a year if I was fortunate, and it was the cake I requested for my birthday every year. If you are looking for a quick recipe, you will want to skip this one, but if you have the time it's well worth the investment. The chocolate lover will appreciate its light texture, but the highlight is certainly the rich chocolate flavor. I hope you give it a try, and enjoy it as much as I have over the years.",
