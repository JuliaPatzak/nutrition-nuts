    "summary": "There's an awesome little restaurant in Marina Del Rey, California called 'Killer Shrimp' that serves up one thing -- Shrimp soup. This is an easy to prepare spicy herb soup with lots of broth, flavor, and a little kick. It doesn't need any fancy presentation. Simply ladle it into big bowls and serve. Don't bother using spoons, just serve it with some crusty bread and use the bread to soak up the broth.",
