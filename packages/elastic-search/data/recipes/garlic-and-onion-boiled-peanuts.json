    "summary": "Here's an original twist to a Southern favorite. The garlic flavor really comes out in this recipe whether the peanuts are served hot or cold.  I love them served room temperature with a cold beer on a summer day! You can also begin cooking the peanuts, then let them soak overnight, and continue cooking the next day. Serve hot or cold, and make sure you have plenty of napkins on hand because these are messy.",
