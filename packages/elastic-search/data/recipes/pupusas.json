    "summary": "This is a fairly authentic version of the popular Salvadorean dish. It does take some time, however it is well worth the effort!  You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it. I also make the salsa roja and curtido ahead of time (the salsa freezes very well, and the curtido can stay in the fridge at least a week).",
