    "summary": "So simple and so delicious you'll want to make an extra one for the next day. It's always the requested dish to bring to parties, from picnics to Thanksgiving. You don't know whether to eat it as a side dish or dessert, but it will be gone either way. My mom calls it 'white trash souffle' because it's best made with that long-lasting, favorite white bread! If desired, garnish with pineapple slices or maraschino cherries.",
