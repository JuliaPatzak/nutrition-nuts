    "summary": "With a homemade crust and a little twist by adding mushrooms, red pepper, and Italian cheese, this crab quiche is extra creamy, light, and smooth. My mom said eating it made her feel like she was in the French countryside. If you don't feel like the hassle of making the crust, use a 9-inch frozen pie crust. Plain mozzarella will work in place of Italian cheese blend, too.",
