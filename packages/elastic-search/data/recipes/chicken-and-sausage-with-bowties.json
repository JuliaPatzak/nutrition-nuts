    "summary": "Necessity is the mother of invention. This recipe was created by me because I had a 1 1/2 hour commute to/from work. I have two teenage boys who require a hearty meal to sustain them for at least 1 hour (maybe less). This recipe can be varied; use pork italian sausage if you like (cook longer), veal or pork cutlets or cubes (be careful to cook pork products thoroughly). Serve as a sandwich, skip the pasta, mix with leftover cooked rice; add small green peas or broccoli. I doubt if anything you try will go wrong. Mangia!",
