    "summary": "These savory little hand pies are so easy to put together. They are a super way to serve spaghetti and meatballs, and are formed by placing a swirl of spaghetti and one meatball onto a circular piece of pastry-style dough, and topping with another piece of slightly larger dough, and crimping the edges closed. Your kids will love these, and if you serve them at a tailgate party, expect them to be gone first!",
