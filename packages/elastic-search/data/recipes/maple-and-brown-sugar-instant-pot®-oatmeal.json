    "summary": "Oatmeal is one of my favorite things to make in the Instant Pot\u00ae because it's foolproof, hands-off, and can be customized a number of different ways. This version of Instant Pot oatmeal is a pot-in-pot pressure cooker oatmeal recipe. This recipe will yield oatmeal with a firm texture (since that's how our family likes it). For softer, mushier oatmeal, increase the pressure cook time by 1 minute.",
