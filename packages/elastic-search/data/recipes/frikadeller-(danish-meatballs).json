    "summary": "This recipe comes straight from my mother-in-law in Denmark. It's a little labor-intensive, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be addicted! Serve warm with a brown sauce, small red boiled potatoes, and sweet and sour cabbage. Better still, double the batch and have enough the next day to slice and place on toast with mayonnaise (open-faced, of course, the Scandinavian way)!",
