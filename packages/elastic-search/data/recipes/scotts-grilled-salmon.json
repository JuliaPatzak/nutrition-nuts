    "summary": "This is my favorite salmon recipe that I put together in college. This can be done on the grill or in the oven. By pairing salmon with rich/tangy lemon, rosemary and garlic sauce, this is a great summertime meal. Serve with grilled/baked veggies (I prefer broccoli, Brussels sprouts or green beans). Enjoy!",
