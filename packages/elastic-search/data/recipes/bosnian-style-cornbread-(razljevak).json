    "summary": "This is a recipe from my hometown of Sarajevo, and it is similar to a southern cornbread. What makes it unique is the addition of semolina flour (or Cream of Wheat\u00ae). If you don't have semolina flour, you can just replace it with additional corn meal. This recipes also makes excellent muffins.",
