        "Cut corner of the bag away, about 1/2-inch wide, to form an opening through which to pipe the dough",
        "Pipe 8 tapered ovals of dough onto the prepared baking sheet to form the 'swan bodies', pulling up at the tapered end to form the 'tail/wingtips'",
        "Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes",
        "While the 'swan bodies' are baking, fill a smaller bag with with the remaining 1/3 the dough; cut a small tip from the corner",

        "Pipe cream to fill each swan 'body', piping up and out the top to resemble swan 'feathers'",
