    "summary": "I love jasmine tea, and was curious how it would taste infused into a cake. I adapted a pound cake recipe I liked and was really happy with the results. The tea is noticeable but not overpowering. I eat this with fresh fruit but I'm sure poached fruit or whipped cream would be great additions.",
