    "summary": "Utilizing the carcass of a rotisserie chicken results in the richest, most flavorful broth you will ever know. This also makes for a good sipping broth. Once you've made this, you will never go back to canned or boxed again. With the help of your Instant Pot\u00ae, you can make this in a fraction of the time it would take to do it in a slow cooker.",
