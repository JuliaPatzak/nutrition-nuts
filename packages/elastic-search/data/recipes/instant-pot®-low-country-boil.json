    "summary": "No more waiting for that large stockpot of water to boil just to drop everything in and wait for it to start boiling again. By utilizing your multi-functional pressure cooker, you not only eliminate that but you also don't have to stand guard over it while it is cooking to make sure it doesn't boil over. Serve with seasoned butter and garnish with chopped parsley and lemon wedges if desired.",
