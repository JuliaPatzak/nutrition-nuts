    "summary": "Comforting homemade potato soup in the Instant Pot\u00ae. While peeling potatoes is not hard, it is a task I very much dislike, so I chose to use red potatoes in my recipe. No peeling necessary and they stay a pretty bright red for added color. Wobbly bacon is another dislike of mine and with this treatment of the bacon, you get all of the flavor throughout the soup and still get to keep the crispy goodness to use on top for garnish.",
