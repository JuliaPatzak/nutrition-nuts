    "summary": "A super simple mild curry for the slow cooker. If you have cashews, they taste great sprinkled on top afterwards. Feel free to spice it up to your liking. I keep it mild so my kids will eat it, too. You don't need to saute anything in advance, everything just goes in the slow cooker as is. I serve it over rice.",
