        "Set aside",
        "Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; stir with a fork until well blended",
        "Combine sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer",
        "Cream together on high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes",
        "Reduce speed to low; add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping the bowl as needed",
