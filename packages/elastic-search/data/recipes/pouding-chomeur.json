    "summary": "Though it translates to 'unemployed man's pudding,' pouding chomeur isn't cheap to make. The good news is you don't really need to eat this more than a few times a year anyway. It's the perfect dessert to pair with summer fruit or vanilla ice cream. If you use a bigger baking dish than I did, and pour over all the maple cream syrup, your cake should float over a pool of what will eventually be your sauce. If you just use a deep pie dish like I did, then just serve the extra sauce on the side.",
