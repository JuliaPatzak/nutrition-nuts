    "summary": "This is a recipe I have worked on for a while and I think it is just about right. It goes well with just about anything from fried fish to hamburgers, and is to die for on a pulled pork sandwich. If you are going to use it with Q, reduce the amount of dressing you add to the cabbage so it's not too sloppy. For best results refrigerate over night to allow flavors to marry.",
