    "summary": "These breakfast sandwiches are perfect to grab and reheat for a quick on-the-go breakfast. They're fast to make and ingredients can be changed for personal customization. Try them with green chiles mixed into the eggs, a different type of cheese, bacon instead of sausage -- the possibilities are endless. Breakfast sandwiches can be frozen and reheated rather quickly.",
