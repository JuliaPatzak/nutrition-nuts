    "summary": "This savory spread is served in the form of a cake and served at Christmas and New Year's parties in Italy. It's decadent spread on bread or crackers. It is usually served with mostarda di frutta (candied fruit in a spicy, sweet syrup). If you can't find that, serve with crisp pears and honey. If you like, you can use sprigs of rosemary, some cinnamon bark, or sticks to decorate a forest scene on the top.",
