    "summary": "The elementary school I attended back in the 1950's used to make these, and were a favorite of most everyone.  My wife and I spent a lot of time trying to recreate these when we were first married. Our kids  (now in their 30's) still request these when they come to visit.  We use canned pizza sauce but spice it up.  Left-overs are easily reheated in the toaster oven.",
