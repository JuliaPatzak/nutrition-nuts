    "summary": "If you have ever wanted to make great authentic Japanese noodle house ramen, this recipe is for you. Great for singles with some cooking experience and a great everyday meal. Might take longer than the overall time without cooking experience. I rarely measure the amount of each ingredient due to the high number of small measurements used to save time.",
