    "summary": "This very fun and simple-to-make candy goes by many names; cinder toffee, sponge candy, and my personal favorite, 'hokey pokey,' but no matter what you call it, this eye-catching confection is a proven crowd pleaser. Thousands of bubbles, trapped in the cooling sugar syrup, give this the most interesting melt-in-your-mouth texture. As long as you're very careful and heat the syrup up to the correct temp, there's not a lot that can go wrong.",

        "Line a baking dish with parchment paper, measure out baking soda in a small bowl, and have a heat-proof spatula ready before starting",

        "Remove candy from the pan by lifting out the parchment paper",
