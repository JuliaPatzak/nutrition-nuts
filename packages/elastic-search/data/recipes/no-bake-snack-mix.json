    "summary": "This is my mom's no-bake snack mix recipe, and it's so much better than the normal snack mix recipes out there. It's tangy, spicy, and insanely addicting! I make it for my coworkers for Christmas and always get requests for the recipe.  What's nice about it is you can vary the proportion of snacks that are in...more oyster crackers, less pretzels, etc. For reference, it makes probably 2 plastic gallon bags' worth of mix. This also freezes well to stay fresh longer.",
