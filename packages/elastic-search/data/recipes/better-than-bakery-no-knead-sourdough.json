    "summary": "This crusty, chewy, tangy bread can't be beat. You'll be shocked at how simple it is to create such a professional loaf at home. Glossy, crunchy crust. Resilient, airy crumb. Baking inside a Dutch oven (set in your kitchen oven) does an excellent job simulating the effects of a professional bread oven.",
