    "summary": "Pan-seared scallops may seem intimidating to some, but it's really a simple dish to  prepare. Sea scallops are amazingly tender, succulent, and mildly flavored, but when you style them up with a flavorful balsamic glaze, they can be a showstopper. They're sophisticated enough for dinner guests, but easy enough for a weeknight dinner.",
