    "summary": "A wonderful family recipe, passed down by my mother (nicknamed Grandma Coffee by my daughters). This recipe gets a unique flavor from the rutabaga used in place of potatoes.  The rutabaga gives it a wonderful flavor, and will not fall apart like potatoes tend to do in soup. I freeze half, and use half immediately. Enjoy with some crusty sourdough or French bread and a garden salad.",
