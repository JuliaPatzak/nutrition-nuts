    "summary": "Although I love zucchini bread, I wanted a new way to prepare it. After some thought I decided to try preparing it pumpkin bread style, since they are both in the squash family. I boiled my zucchini (skins attached), and then pureed it. It is so similar to pumpkin bread in texture, and the taste... it is out of this world.",
