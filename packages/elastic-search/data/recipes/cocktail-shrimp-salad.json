    "summary": "A nice Mexican-inspired shrimp salad that is highly rated and requested, especially during the summer months. Easy to make, and ingredients can be adjusted to your liking. It is great with regular saltines; however, for it to be authentic, place salad on tostadas and top off with diced avocado and a splash of bottled hot sauce for a true experience!",
