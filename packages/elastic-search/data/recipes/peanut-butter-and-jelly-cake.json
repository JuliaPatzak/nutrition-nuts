    "summary": "This nostalgic PB&J cake is a whimsical nod to the lunchbox favorite. The \"bread\" of this towering dessert sandwich is a tender white cake baked in square pans and sliced horizontally into four layers. Trimming away the top golden-brown crust of the cake gives it the appearance of white sandwich bread. If you'd prefer, you could use a box cake mix in place of the homemade cake--just be aware that your layers may not be as thick. The peanut butter-cream cheese filling is incredibly easy to mix up, and you can use whatever flavor jam or jelly that you prefer!",

        "Lightly grease two 8-inch square baking pans with baking spray",
        "Line the bottom of each pan with a square piece of parchment paper",
        "Spray parchment with baking spray, then flour each parchment-lined pan, shaking away any excess flour",
        "Whisk cake flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl; set aside",

        "Add the flour mixture, alternately with the milk, with the mixer running on low speed, beginning and ending with the flour",
        "Beat egg whites in a clean mixing bowl at medium speed until stiff peaks form",
        "Gently fold egg whites into the batter",
        "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes tests clean, 30 to 35 minutes",

        "Place jelly in a small mixing bowl and whisk to loosen",
        "Carefully transfer one cake layer to a cake plate or serving platter",
        "Gently spread 1/3 of the peanut butter mixture over the cake, spreading all the way to the edges",
