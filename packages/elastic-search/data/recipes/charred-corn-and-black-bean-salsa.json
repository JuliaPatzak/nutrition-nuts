    "summary": "This charred corn salsa came about when I wanted to make use of some leftover ingredients after making a Mexican dish the night before. Broiling a few of the ingredients up front and using fire-roasted tomatoes gives it a nice smoky flavor. The recipe as-is will yield a salsa on the spicier side of mild. Alter the spice level by increasing or decreasing chili powder to taste. Serve with chips or use in any recipe that calls for salsa.",
