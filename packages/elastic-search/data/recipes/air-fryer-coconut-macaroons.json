    "summary": "Nutty, sweet, and exactly what you expect from a coconut macaroon! The texture is crispy on the outside and somewhat sticky and chewy on the inside. The chocolate adds a nice bitterness that cuts through the sweetness. These are so easy to prepare and would make great gifts, plus, they're easy to freeze!",
