    "summary": "This is a delish cookie recipe I have perfected to make soft but firm cookies. These are made for lactating mommies, however my whole family enjoys these cookies. If you don't need them for lactation you can remove the brewer's yeast. The ingredients which help boost milk supply for breast feeding are the coconut oil, oats, brewer's yeast, and flax meal, so do not skip those. Store in an airtight cookie jar. Dough can be frozen.",
