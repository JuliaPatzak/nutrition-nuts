    "summary": "I grew up in Little Sweden, USA, and my great-grandparents on my Mom's side were all from Sweden. This is the recipe I grew up with (I added the nutmeg as I like nutmeg). I love these and make them for family brunches all the time. They even taste good as leftovers, as pancakes again, or with peanut butter instead. We serve these with just syrup and butter, but many use lingonberries, or other fruit or jams.",
