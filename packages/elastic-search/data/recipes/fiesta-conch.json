    "summary": "This recipe is a result of my intro to conch while spending several years sailing off the coast of Florida and in the Caribbean. Hope you enjoy. Serve immediately over white rice or fine noodles along with a green veggie such as peas or whole green beans and warm French baguettes. White wine really sets it off. Note: The sauce may be prepared ahead and refrigerated 3-4 days or frozen until ready to use. Simply reheat, add conch, and serve.",
