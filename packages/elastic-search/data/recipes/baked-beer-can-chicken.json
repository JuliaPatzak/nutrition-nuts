    "summary": "This chicken always turns out juicy and tender with robust flavor. Are you tired of the same old boring chicken? Try this one! It is so easy to prepare and cook. There are other versions that can be cooked on the grill but we prefer ours in the oven. It's a dinner our whole family loves.",
