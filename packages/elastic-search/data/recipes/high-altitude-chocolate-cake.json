    "summary": "This moist chocolate cake never collapses, something I can't say for other cakes I've baked at high altitude! This cake has been tested at 9,000 feet and always turns out fluffy and moist! Frost this delicious layer cake with cream cheese vanilla bean frosting. Bailey's\u00ae buttercream or mocha frosting are also great choices.",
