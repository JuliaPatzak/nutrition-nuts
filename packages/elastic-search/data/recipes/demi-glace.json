    "summary": "This is my technique for veal demi-glace, and there's not much to it. I'm going for a pure veal stock reduction, fortified with nothing more than mirepoix and tomato. I don't do the classic roux-based espagnole sauce, which is traditionally mixed with veal stock and reduced by half.",
