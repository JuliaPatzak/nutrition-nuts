    "summary": "In order to get that single flat steak cut from the chicken thigh, it actually takes some precision and some knife handling skills. But all that peeling, deboning, cutting, and marinating is all worth it. I got the savory sweet flavors that bulgogi marinades are known for but made even better with the tender and juicy thighs that were soaked overnight. Serve this with a bunch of Boston/Bibb lettuce, garnished with scallion strips.",
