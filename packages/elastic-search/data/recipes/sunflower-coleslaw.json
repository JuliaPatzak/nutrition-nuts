    "summary": "I was making my old regular coleslaw one afternoon and found it too bland for company. I only had a few items on hand at the time to tweak the recipes, and pickles did not seem appropriate. So this is what I came up with. Very simple but very tasty. Since you use salted sunflower seeds, use salt sparingly.",
