    "summary": "This milkshake has extra protein from black beans, the deep chocolate taste is from cacao (not to be confused with cocoa) powder and is dressed up with optional whipped cream, peanuts, and chocolate drizzle. I cannot promise similar results using a standard blender, such as a Ninja\u00ae.",
