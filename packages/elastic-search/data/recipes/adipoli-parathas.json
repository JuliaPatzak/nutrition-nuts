        "To make the dough, place the flour into a mixing bowl",
        "Gradually stir in 1/4 cup vegetable oil and the water to make a soft, pliable dough",
        "Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 4 minutes",
        "Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside for 1 hour",
        "Heat 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat",
        "Sprinkle in the mustard seeds; when the seeds start to pop, stir in the green chile, ginger, onions, and curry leaves",
        "Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes",
        "Add the turmeric and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 minute more",
        "Mix in the prawns and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes",
        "Remove from the heat and set aside",
        "Divide the dough into 8 equal portions",
        "Place one piece in the palm of your hands and roll it into a smooth ball",

        "Heat a cast iron skillet or heavy frying pan over medium heat",

        "Place a circle of dough into the preheated skillet",
        "Spread 3 tablespoons of filling over the dough",
        "Cook until the bottom of the bread has browned, about 5 minutes",
        "Lower the heat and carefully turn the paratha over with a spatula",
        "Cook for an additional 5 minutes so the prawn mixture is well stuck to the paratha",
        "Flip the paratha over again and transfer it to a cutting board",
        "Roll the paratha into a cylinder shape to enclose the filling",
        "Repeat with the remaining dough and filling",
        "Cut each stuffed paratha in half to serve"
