    "summary": "Often served with (and dipped in!) white wine, taralli are a fun and versatile Italian snack you can flavor all sorts of ways. This pepper and cheese variety starts with a simple unleavened dough starring white wine and olive oil. Rolled into ropes, then into rings, they're boiled and sprinkled with cheese before baking. Once baked, the cheese forms a crispy wafer in the middle of the ring!",
