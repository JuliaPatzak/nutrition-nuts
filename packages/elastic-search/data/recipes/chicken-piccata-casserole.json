    "summary": "I love chicken piccata, but I don't love cooking it on top of the stove. Get the great piquant taste of chicken piccata, without the spatters, in the oven! It's more convenient, and it frees you up to tend to the other parts of dinner, like some tasty pasta, and maybe a vegetable or a salad.",
