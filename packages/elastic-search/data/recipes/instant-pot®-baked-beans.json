    "summary": "This recipe was passed down through my French Canadian family from my grandmother, to my mother and then to me many years ago. It traditionally takes hours to make, as we let the beans slow cook overnight in the oven on low heat. I decided to try and transform it into a much quicker Instant Pot\u00ae recipe with great success! With this method, you don't even have to presoak the beans. These are even better the next day, and they freeze well, too.",
