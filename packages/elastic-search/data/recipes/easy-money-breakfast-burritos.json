    "summary": "Yummy burritos that are so good that my husband was selling them for a buck apiece at corp school in the Navy. I was making them every night, and we bought a new couch with the money!  These freeze really well; just defrost and eat. I also add fresh cooked mushrooms in these on occasion.  I do find that these taste better when made ahead of time and eaten at a later time.",
