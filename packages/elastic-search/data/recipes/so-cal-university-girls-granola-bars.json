    "summary": "I adapted a few granola bars to fit my needs as a short-on-cash college kid. They're easy to adapt to what you have in your pantry and perfect to store individually for a healthy grab-and-go snack! Using dried cherries gives the bars a tarty edge! I recommend cutting bars and storing in refrigerator wrapped individually for grab-and-go snacking.",
