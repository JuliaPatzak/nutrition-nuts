    "summary": "Eating the skin of apples provides about twice the anti-cancer activity as eating only the pulp, Cornell University studies show. That's why this recipe says not to peel the apple. You may wonder about the hefty amount of fat in each serving. Don't: 90% of it is good monounsaturated fat from avocado and pecans.",
