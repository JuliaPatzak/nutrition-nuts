    "summary": "These lumpia are the only thing my Filipina mom can cook that actually taste good and don't pose a fire hazard to her kitchen. They're made a bit differently, the meat mixture isn't cooked before rolling. They can be made ahead of time and frozen. My family requests these all the time and they're always the first thing gone. If you don't want to make your own dipping sauce, our favorite is LaChoy\u00ae brand sweet and sour sauce.",
