    "summary": "This is a big, messy sandwich that sounds quirky but is delicious!  Great for warming up in the fall and very kid-friendly. The proportions of this recipe are approximate, and feel free to change them to suit your needs.  The bacon provides saltiness, the jelly provides sweetness, the apple provides tartness, and the cayenne pepper the spiciness.  However, including all ingredients provides a more complex range of awesomeness.",
