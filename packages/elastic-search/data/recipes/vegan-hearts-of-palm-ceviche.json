    "summary": "This light vegan ceviche with hearts of palm, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro gets its spice from serrano peppers. You can serve it in a jar with chips or as a topping over tostadas. Even though you can eat the ceviche right away, it tastes best after it has been chilled for a couple of hours in the fridge. [Recipe originally submitted to Allrecipes.com.mx]",
