    "summary": "Everyone really enjoys this salad; it features wild rice, chicken, and cashews along with plump juicy red grapes. Besides wild rice, the real star of this salad is the dressing that uses curry powder to provide a delicious and unique flavor. And like a lot of dishes, it is best served after sitting overnight to ensure all the flavors get a chance to know each other!!",
