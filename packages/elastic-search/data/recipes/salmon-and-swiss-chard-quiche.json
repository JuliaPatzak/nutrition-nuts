    "summary": "This is a crustless quiche that looks and tastes great.  Red Swiss chard makes the quiche very attractive.  It would also be good with half the salmon and twice the chard for a different flavor emphasis. The quiche can also be baked in your favorite crust if you prefer. Just bake a little longer",
