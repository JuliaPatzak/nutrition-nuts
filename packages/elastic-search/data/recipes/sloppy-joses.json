    "summary": "The slightly sweet, mildly spicy blend of nourishing ingredients takes a south-of-the-border sojourn, served in these easy, warm Sloppy Joses taco bowls. This hearty dish couldn't be easier to make--a can of sauce, a can of beans, a can of Mexican-style corn and cooked ground beef. It's the same high-protein, one-skillet meal kids love, but served with a little Mexican twist.",
