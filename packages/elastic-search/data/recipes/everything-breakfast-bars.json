    "summary": "I was looking for something I could make ahead on weekends for a quick weekday breakfast and nothing I found was quite right so I made my own, using elements of others and adding things I love. I wrap them individually in foil and freeze, take one out the night before to thaw, then warm it in the toaster oven while I'm getting ready for work.",
