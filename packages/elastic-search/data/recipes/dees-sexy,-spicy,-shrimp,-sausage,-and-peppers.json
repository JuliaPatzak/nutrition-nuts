    "directions": [
        "Place the shrimp, shallot, 1 clove of garlic, creole seasoning, and 1/4 cup of olive oil in a bowl, and stir to coat the shrimp with the marinade",
        "Set the shrimp aside",
        "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil",
        "Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil",
        "Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes",
        "Drain well in a colander set in the sink",
        "While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet, and brown the sausages on all sides until they are evenly brown, about 10 minutes",

        "To serve, place about 1/2 cup of cooked pasta on a warmed plate, and spoon shrimp over one side of the pasta, and sausage and peppers on the other side"
