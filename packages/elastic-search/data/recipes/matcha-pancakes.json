    "summary": "We're strong believers in sleeping in and brunching on the weekends (we didn't work hard all week for nothing!), so it's only natural that we treat ourselves to one of our favorite brunch foods: the classic pancake. There's just something about stacks of fluffy, buttery breakfast cakes that makes us feel like we're starting the morning off with dessert, especially if there are chocolate chips inside. Happy brunching! Top with more white chocolate chips, honey, butter, and enjoy.",
