    "summary": "They say that whoever makes the most delicious thing with the fewest number of ingredients wins, which was the idea that inspired these. The recipe reminded me just how delicious pork ribs are when we don't try to do too much to them. Plus, this has to be the easiest method I've ever shared for doing ribs.",

        "Mix salt, black pepper, white pepper, cayenne, and garlic powder together in a small bowl",
        "Set spice rub aside",
        "Stir Dijon mustard and vinegar together in a small bowl",
        "Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet",
        "Turn the ribs over so that the meat side is down",
        "Use the tip of a small, sharp knife to make some very shallow slashes every few inches through the membrane that covers the ribs",
        "Poke the knife 3 or 4 times between each rib bone, about 1/4 inch deep",
        "Brush about 1/2 of the Dijon mustard mixture on top",
        "Sprinkle with about 40% of the spice rub",
        "Turn the rack over and brush on the rest of the mustard and vinegar mixture",
        "Sprinkle on the rest of the rub, reserving 1 or 2 teaspoons in case you want to use it to season the cooked ribs later",
        "Refrigerate the ribs, uncovered, 4 to 12 hours before baking",
        "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)",
        "Remove ribs from the refrigerator",
        "Cook in the center of the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours",
        "Remove from the oven and baste with the pan drippings",
        "Continue to cook until very tender and the tip of a knife slides in very easily, about 1 1/2 hours more",
        "Remove from the oven, baste again, and let ribs rest for 15 minutes before cutting and serving"
