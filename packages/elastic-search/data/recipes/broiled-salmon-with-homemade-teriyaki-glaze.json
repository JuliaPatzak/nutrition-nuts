    "summary": "Simple salmon cooked under the oven's broiler with a homemade teriyaki glaze. I really like how well teriyaki flavor pairs with salmon but store-bought teriyaki sauce is so thin and doesn't stay on but runs underneath the fish. I came up with this homemade version that is more of a glaze that stays on the fish.",
