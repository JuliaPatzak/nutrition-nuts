    "summary": "When I don't have fresh fruit on hand, I like to use frozen fruit to make this versatile and easy coulis recipe. My favorite frozen fruit blend is cherry-berry, made up of sweet cherries, tart cherries, strawberries and blueberries, but feel free to use what you prefer. The coulis can be used on cheesecake, ice cream, yogurt, crepes - the possibilities are endless! Refrigerate for up to 1 week.",
