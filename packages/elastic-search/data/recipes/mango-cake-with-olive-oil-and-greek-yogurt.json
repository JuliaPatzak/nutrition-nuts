    "summary": "This is a terrific and easy mango cake recipe that turned out even better than I expected. The mix of olive oil and butter along with the Greek yogurt is what I think makes this cake incredibly moist and flavorful. It's great for using overripe mango or even mango that isn't as sweet as you had hoped.",
