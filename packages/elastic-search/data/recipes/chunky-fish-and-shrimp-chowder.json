    "summary": "Can't believe I made this all on my own. I was inspired by other fish chowder and stew recipes. It was so good it surprised me! My family went back for seconds. I wanted the soup to be chunky, so I made sure water didn't rise above the levels of the other ingredients. It was the perfect meal to break my fast with, and my family. (It's Ramadan! hehe) Ramadan Kareem! Peace be upon you.",
