    "summary": "Shrimp is one of my favorite weeknight meals, because it is so quick to prepare! The Cuban-style marinade is full of citrus flavors with a few surprises. Normally, \"mojo\" means a flavor based on Seville oranges, and these sour oranges can be hard to find. A bit of extra lime, some grapefruit juice, and vinegar stand in for the brightness of the missing Seville oranges in this recipe. The red pepper flakes add just a little zing, so if you like spicy foods, feel free to add more, to your taste. We like this with simple white rice and some black beans, or a side of grilled mixed veggies.",
