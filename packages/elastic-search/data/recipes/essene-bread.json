    "summary": "This is a sprouted bread recipe - very old, and said to have been created back in the biblical days.  Also, this recipe literally, takes days to make. Your efforts and time will be well rewarded with a couple of the most singular breads-solid, sweet, and moist. Wheat berries are available from your local natural foods store.  Traditionally, Essene bread was probably baked on hot rocks under scorching sunlight, but where I and most of us live, this is not possible. Baking at the oven temperatures which I suggest might destroy the sprout enzymes, but monitoring baking loaves for much longer than 2 hours is too long for me. Guaranteeing the preservation of the enzymes might require baking at a very low temperature for perhaps 4 hours. If you have the stamina, then go for it.",

    "ingredients": [
        "3 cups wheat berries",
        "3 cups water to cover",
        "1 tablespoon cornmeal"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Beginning several days before you hope to be eating this bread, rinse the wheat berries in cool water, drain and submerge the berries with cool water in a large bowl",
        "Cover the bowl with a plate or cloth, and allow the berries to soak at normal room temperature overnight or for about 12 hours",
        "The berries will soak up a considerable amount of water",
        "Drain the berries in a colander, cover the colander with a plate to prevent the berries from drying out, and set it in a place away from light and where the sun won't shine on it",
        "Rinse the berries about 3 times a day, and they will soon begin to sprout",
        "In a couple of days the sprouts will reach their optimum length of about l/4 inch",
        "Growth depends on moisture and temperature so be patient",
        "Grind in a food mill or in a food processor",
        "After grinding, dump the mushed up grain onto a clean work surface",
        "Squeeze and knead the grain for about 10 minutes, and then form up 2 small round, hearth-style loaves with your hands",
        "Sprinkle an insulated cookie sheet with a little bran or cornmeal, and put the loaves on it",
        "Preheating the oven is not necessary",
        "Cover the loaves with cloches, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes",
        "Then turn the oven down to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and bake for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes more",
        "Allow the breads to cool thoroughly on cooling racks for several hours, and then, because of the high moisture content, store in the refrigerator"
