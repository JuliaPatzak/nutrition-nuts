    "summary": "Simple, cheap, quick, and tasty! You can make it easily while traveling or camping. Good for backpacking or just a quick snack. This got me through many nights traveling in Guatemala and Mexico on a very limited budget. I still like to make it even with a full kitchen because it reminds me of camping at the Mayan ruins. The tuna with oil is preferable, and if the avocado is good quality and ripe, you might not even need any salt.",
