    "summary": "My daughter and I found this recipe several years ago, and since then it has become a regular on our Christmas menu. Strangely, this dish appeals especially to women. Women always return for seconds and request the recipe, while men may politely try a bite or two. We serve it mainly with chicken or turkey. With an apple or banana on the side, it also makes a filling and nutritious packed lunch. Somehow the sweet potato sticks by you so that you're not reaching for a snack at mid-afternoon.",
