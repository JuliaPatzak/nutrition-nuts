    "summary": "I just tried this tonight, and it was the perfect fall recipe!  Warm, filling, and simple.  The savory scallops complement the slightly sweet soup.  Top with some whole grain crackers and you have an excellent meal. This recipe is great for your full meal, or in smaller servings as a starting course.  Vegetarians and vegans may substitute marinated meat substitute (please do not add salt) for the scallops, soy milk for cow's milk, and olive oil for the butter.",
