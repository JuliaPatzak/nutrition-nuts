    "summary": "Remember the viral TikTok Feta Pasta? We're giving the same place-and-bake pasta method new life in the form of a decadent, four-cheese mac and cheese. In just under an hour, you'll get a creamy, crowd-pleasing side that's even easier to throw together than the box you grab off the shelf (but so much tastier). Feel free to mix in some truffle oil or top with crushed Ritz\u00ae crackers.",
