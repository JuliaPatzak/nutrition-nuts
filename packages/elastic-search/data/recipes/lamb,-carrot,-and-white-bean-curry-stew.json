    "summary": "Based on the ingredients of the lula kebab, this Middle Eastern-derived recipe uses ground lamb, carrots, and white beans to create a tasty stew-like dish for serving over rice. It's good for those one-bowl meals and reheats well. The flavors get even better after a day. Add more meat and fewer beans if you like a meatier dish. Also, you can mix in beef with lamb, but the lamb flavor is essential. I like cumin, but you can always take away the spice, or try adding a minced serrano chili pepper or two for some heat.",
