    "summary": "This salsa is so easy to throw together on days when you already have the smoker going. Tweak it to your preferred heat level by leaving some or all of the jalapeno seeds in for a spicier salsa! The longer you let the salsa sit, the better it becomes. I like to use hickory wood, but fruit woods also work great.",
