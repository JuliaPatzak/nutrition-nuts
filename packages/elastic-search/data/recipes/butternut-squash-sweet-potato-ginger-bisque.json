    "summary": "This soup is perfect in winter-time. The root vegetables are comforting and the ginger is warming. Increase or decrease the amount of ginger to suit your taste. Chicken or vegetable stock may be substituted for the water. Either a blender or food processor can be used to puree the soup. If desired, add cream instead of yogurt to enrich the taste.",
