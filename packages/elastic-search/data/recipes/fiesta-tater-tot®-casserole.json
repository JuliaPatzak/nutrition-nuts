    "summary": "We invented this recipe one night after one of us wanted Tater Tot\u00ae casserole for supper, while the other wanted Mexican...It's SUPER easy and SUPER yummy! Baking the Tater Tots\u00ae before layering may be unnecessary but we wanted to make sure they had a chance to crisp up. The whole family LOVED this dish! Hope you do too!",
