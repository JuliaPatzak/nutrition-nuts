    "summary": "Getting my super picky kids to eat vegetables is always a challenge. My oldest loves chocolate and my youngest loves blueberries, so I combined the two into one recipe. I used a blend of whole wheat and white flours, added some flax seed, and tried to keep both sugar and fat content on the lower end. Enjoy!",
