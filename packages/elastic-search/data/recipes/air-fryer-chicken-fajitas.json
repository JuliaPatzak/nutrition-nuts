    "summary": "Chicken fajitas in the air fryer doesn't get any easier than this. The chicken stays nice and moist while the vegetables have a nice crisp to them. Add 2 minutes of cook time if you prefer softer veggies. I like to toast my tortillas in the air fryer as well but it is not necessary. Serve with toppings of your choice such as salsa, sliced avocado, and cheese.",
