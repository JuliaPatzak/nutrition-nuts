    "summary": "This pasta dish is not really risotto; it only refers to the similar technique used in that famous Italian dish. Like the grains of Arborio rice, pieces of broken pasta are tossed in hot butter or oil before the liquid is added, but here we're going even further, and toasting it to a gorgeous nut-brown. This gives the dish its signature look, as well as adds a subtle nutty flavor.",
