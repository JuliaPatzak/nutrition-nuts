    "summary": "This cookie gets its name from the West Coast Trail on Vancouver Island. It's my adaptation of the perfect nut-free trail cookie that's been our family's favorite chewy oatmeal cookie for 10 years. Loaded with choco-chips and dried cranberries. The flax seed meal and pumpkin seeds give them a nutty taste, without the nuts. Perfect for school kids or those with allergies.",
