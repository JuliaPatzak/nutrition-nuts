    "summary": "The beauty of aioli made in the traditional method with a mortar and pestle is that a small amount of garlic can flavor a large amount of mayo. Also, this real aioli is so strong and powerful that you don't need half a cup of mayo on your grilled fish. Just a teaspoon of my version is so intense it will fully flavor a whole piece of meat or pile of veggies.",
