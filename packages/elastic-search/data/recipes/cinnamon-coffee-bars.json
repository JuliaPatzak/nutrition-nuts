    "summary": "This is a quick and easy bar. It has raisins and nuts in it.  Great with a hot cup of coffee or even a cold glass of milk.  My daughter likes them as an after school snack. Cut into bars and frost while still warm with confectioners' sugar glaze or let them cool and frost with cream cheese icing.",
