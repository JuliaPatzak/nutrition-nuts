    "summary": "Edamame adds a unique twist (and a great nutrition boost) to this delicious, tender pork stew. It makes a great supper on a cold evening. My family absolutely loves this stew and has insisted on having weekly since I first made it. It's just as tasty when served as leftovers. It's also a very adaptable recipe, so it is easy to adjust to suit your family's tastes. I hope you enjoy as much as my family does! Serve with rice!",
