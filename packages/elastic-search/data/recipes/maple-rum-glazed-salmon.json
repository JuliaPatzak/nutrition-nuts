    "summary": "Very easy recipe for oven roasted salmon fillets with a maple-rum glaze. The first time I made it this instantly eclipsed another salmon recipe (with an orange-ginger sauce) that we had used and loved for years. Some folks might write this off due to the mustard, but the flavors blend so well it is undetectable.",
