    "summary": "The first time I tried these, a co-worker on a specialized team brought them in for breakfast. She got them from Starbucks\u00ae (a seasonal delight, I'm told). So, I checked them out after I got off from work and at over $2 per little \"triangle\" piece, I decided I'd learn to make them for a lot less. My family members all urged me to recreate these. So after a bit of research, I found that there's a few copycat recipes online; but this is my twist on that concept.",
