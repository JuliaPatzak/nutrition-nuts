    "summary": "I tried 'Chicken Charlie's Deep Fried Kool-Aid\u00ae' at the San Diego County Fair. They were very good so I started to search on a way to recreate them. I searched for drop doughnut recipes and took one of those and adapted it.  This is a very close version of the one I had at the fair in looks and taste. The fair's version was cherry-flavored, but you could use any flavor you like.",
