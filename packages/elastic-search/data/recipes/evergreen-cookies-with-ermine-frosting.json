    "summary": "A simple, no-roll sugar cookie that makes 3D trees and wreaths. This old-school frosting, stabilized and volumized with a milk-and-flour roux and equal parts butter and shortening, makes for a fluffy, yet sturdy, topping that's not too sweet to pipe on generously. Decorate with sugar pearls, dragees, or sprinkles. Once set, cookies can be stored in a single layer in an airtight container up to 3 days, or frozen up to 3 months.",
