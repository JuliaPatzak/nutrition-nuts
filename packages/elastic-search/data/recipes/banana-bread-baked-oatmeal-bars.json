    "summary": "This is the perfect breakfast for those days when you really want a muffin but need something hearty and healthy like oatmeal. For the best flavor use a very ripe banana. Any fruit can be substituted for the banana, including dried fruit (cranberries!) and nuts. The bars are great the next day, too. Once cool, put the bars into the fridge, then pop them in the microwave for a few seconds before eating.",
