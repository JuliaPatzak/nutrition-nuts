    "summary": "Had some ripe avocados left over. They were extras from guacamole the previous weekend. So I gave this quick and extremely easy recipe a shot on the grill, and the wife and kids loved it. Fresh ones are good too. Use paprika instead of the chipotle and chili powder for less spicy. Canola oil can be substituted for olive oil if desired.",
