    "summary": "So easy to make and it's delicious! Take advantage of plum season to make this torte. The torte base will complement many types of fruit. I've used regular plums and quartered them and it was super tasty too. Next time, I'll try it with apricots. I use just a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar because I'm not a fan of sweet desserts. Serve plain or with vanilla ice cream.",
