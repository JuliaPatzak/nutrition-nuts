    "summary": "A yummy soup that even picky kids will love! Red beans and black beans are mildly seasoned and simmered in vegetable broth. With these ingredients this is a healthy vegetarian soup with a complete protein. If you add the chili powder, leave out the maple syrup. It totally changes the taste. Garnish with sour cream, green onions and tortilla chips for a festive meal. This is great served with cornbread.",
