    "summary": "A simply delicious meal! Sure to make your kitchen smell amazing! This recipe is very versatile, as well.  For example, you may find it easier to use lima beans instead of edamame. Also you could use a different type of fish if you don't like tuna. You could even use fresh herbs for a burst of flavor! Feel free to experiment. Enjoy!",
