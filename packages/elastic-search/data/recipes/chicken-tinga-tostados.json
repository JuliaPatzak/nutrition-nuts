    "summary": "This authentic Mexican recipe I picked up while living in Mexico.  It has a spicy, smoky flavor from chipotle peppers.  It is perfect for a buffet where people can serve themselves and even better heated up as leftovers the next day! If this is too spicy for you, try using less chipotle peppers.",
