    "summary": "This recipe is a quick and easy way to enjoy jambalaya without spending too much time in the kitchen. It has just enough spice to give it a kick without making it too spicy. I use turkey kielbasa to make this recipe a little more healthy. I also suggest making your own home-mixed Cajun seasoning to avoid too many unnecessary additives.",
