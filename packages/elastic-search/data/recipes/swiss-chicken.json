    "summary": "This is a wonderful recipe.  This was given to our family years ago by a good friend through the Boy Scouts. My brother would eat it all if he was allowed to and now my children who are both little love this dish. For people on a low budget this is an easy meal to make and it is easy to reheat. My mother, who does not eat chicken, loves the topping of this dish.",
