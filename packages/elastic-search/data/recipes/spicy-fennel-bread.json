    "summary": "The smell of this spicy fennel bread is still lingering in the house making me feel so cozy! A few years ago, a breakfast spot opened up downtown that started making spicy fennel bagels. As an avid everything bagel lover, I was not sure at first but was quickly convinced to give it a try. Oh my goodness, was I happily surprised. The spice given off by the fennel was perfection melted into the bagel. A bit later I moved and craved these bagels so I decided to make my own version, spicy fennel bread.",
