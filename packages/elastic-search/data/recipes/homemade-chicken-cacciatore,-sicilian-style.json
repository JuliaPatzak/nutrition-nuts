    "summary": "This recipe was shown to me by my Sicilian employer years ago in Lynchburg, VA. It is made from scratch with tomatoes, onions, peppers, wine, and seasonings. Do not cook chicken before adding to this recipe; it must all blend together to get this particular flavor. Leaving the skin on the chicken helps the flavors to blend together while cooking. You can remove the skin after cooking.",
