    "ingredients": [
        "7 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
        "3 tablespoons ground almonds",
        "\u00bc teaspoon baking powder",
        "\u00bc pound pie crust pastry",
        "2 tablespoons strawberry jam",
        "\u00bc cup butter",
        "\u00bc cup superfine sugar",
        "1  egg",
        "\u00bc teaspoon lemon zest",
        "1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar  (Optional)"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)",
        "Grease an 8 inch pie plate",
        "Whisk together the flour, ground almonds, and baking powder; set aside",
        "Roll the pie crust pastry into a round shape a little larger than the pie plate",
        "Cut off a 1/2-inch wide strip from the edge of the pastry circle, and line the lower sides of the pie plate with the strip, placing the cut side upwards (the pastry will not reach the rim of the pie plate)",
        "Dampen the strip with water, then place the remaining pie pastry circle into the pie plate, pressing to seal the edges of the circle onto the strip where the pastry overlaps",
        "This will create a crust that is slightly thicker around the lower edges",
        "Spread the strawberry jam evenly over the center of the pastry shell",
        "Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a bowl until light and fluffy",
        "Whisk the egg together with the lemon zest, and add gradually to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition",
        "Gently fold the flour mixture, a spoonful at a time, into the egg mixture, folding until just incorporated",
        "Spread the batter over the jam in the pie shell",
        "Bake the tart in the preheated oven until the filling is firmly set and browned, about 30 minutes",
        "Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar"
