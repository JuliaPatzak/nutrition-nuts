    "summary": "I don't know what it is about this combination of flavors, but I could eat these every day. Even though it contains the right ingredients in the right proportions for a teriyaki sauce, which is what I was aiming for originally, to describe the flavor as such would be inaccurate. I'm usually perfectly happy with this and a bowl of rice as a meal in itself, but when I'm forced to share, it pairs well with roasted chicken or just about any kind of pork.",

        "Transfer the seeds immediately to a bowl to stop the cooking process",
        "Set seeds aside",
        "Place sesame oil in the hot skillet, and heat until it just begins to smoke (this should happen very fast)",

        "With a spatula, gently toss the greens until they are wilted and reduced in quantity, about 2 minutes",
        "Mix in garlic, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sake, and sugar",
