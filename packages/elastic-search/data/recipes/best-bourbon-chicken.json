    "summary": "Bourbon Chicken is traditionally a Southern dish, and after moving to Pennsylvania from Oklahoma, I really missed this. I searched for a recipe I liked, but I couldn't find one, so this is my own delicious version, spiced up with ginger, fruit juice, red pepper, and a little Southern Comfort! Serve over rice.",
