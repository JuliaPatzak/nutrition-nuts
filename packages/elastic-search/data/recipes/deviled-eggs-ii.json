        "Place eggs in a pot of salted water",

        "Drain eggs, and let cool",
        "Once cool, remove the shell, cut the eggs in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks",
        "Place the yolks in a medium-size mixing bowl and mash them",
        "Blend in vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper",
        "You may need to add more mayonnaise to hold the mixture together, but it should be slightly dry",
