    "summary": "This is something my mom used to make when I was growing up.  It's easy, inexpensive and filling!  I always make sure my canned salmon is wild caught for a healthier fish.  I also like to leave the bones in for the calcium - just crush them up between your fingers (they are really soft) as you come across them when you are mixing everything with your hands.  This is a nice recipe to have children help out with and they love to get their hands messy and be able to eat what they made for dinner.",
