    "summary": "It takes three days to make this panettone, which I thought was otherwise a pretty straightforward bread recipe. Besides dried fruit, there are so many other things you can include, such as nuts, and chocolate chips, just in case this seems too healthy. Serve plain, with butter, or even better, toasted with butter.",
