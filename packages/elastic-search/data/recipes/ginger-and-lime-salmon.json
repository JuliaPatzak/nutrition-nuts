    "summary": "JW and I decided to make 2010 'the summer of ginger and lime.' We used a ton of fresh ginger and limes from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and by far, this was our favorite creation. Grill it or broil it. Either way, this salmon is fantastic! We serve this with a tossed green salad and steamed jasmine rice.",
