    "summary": "For those who have experienced the omnivore version of a gyro, the taste cannot be forgotten. For those vegans who never have, but want something really awesome in a pita bread with hot food, cold veggies, and tangy yogurt sauce, this is what you are looking for! You can eat these sandwiches open-faced, or fold them in half (like a taco) to enjoy the way they were meant to be eaten.",
