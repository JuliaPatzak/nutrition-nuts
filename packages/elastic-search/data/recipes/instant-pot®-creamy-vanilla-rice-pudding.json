    "summary": "This is an extra-rich rice pudding made with short grain rice, a nod to my Okinawan heritage. The recipe calls for already-cooked short-grain rice (likely from a rice cooker) and is a great way to use leftover rice. Make it for breakfast, as a snack, or serve it for dessert! Add additional milk or cream to each bowl when serving, if you like.",
