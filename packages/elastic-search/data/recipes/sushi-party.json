It Includes California rolls, Boston Rolls, Lobster rolls, tempura eggplant and avocado rolls, pesto and egg rolls, and shrimp and asparagus rolls (we did not include any raw ingredients, since our people are a bit squeamish and reluctant to eat anything raw). Mix and match the fillings, as desired. Serve with pickled ginger, wasabi paste, and soy sauce.",
