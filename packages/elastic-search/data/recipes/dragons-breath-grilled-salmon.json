    "summary": "I came up with this recipe for my Husband's boss who can not get enough heat or garlic in his food.  He still requests this dish often, according to this wife. Warning: I would not recommend this recipe for a first date or a romantic evening.  You will love it if you love garlic and very spicy food.  It's also very good on French bread for a spicy garlic bread alternative.",
