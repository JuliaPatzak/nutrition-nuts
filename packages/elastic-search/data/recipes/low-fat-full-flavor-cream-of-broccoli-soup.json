    "ingredients": [
        "1 tablespoon butter",
        "4  leeks, chopped",
        "\u00bc teaspoon salt",
        "\u00bd teaspoon fresh ground black pepper",
        "\u00bc teaspoon ground coriander",
        "2 heads fresh broccoli, chopped",
        "1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth",
        "1 (12 fluid ounce) can fat-free evaporated milk"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Melt butter in a large pot, and cook the leeks over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes",
        "Stir in salt, pepper, and coriander",
        "Reserve about 1/4 cup of small broccoli florets, and cook the rest of the broccoli with the leeks until the broccoli is bright green, about 5 more minutes",
        "Pour in the chicken stock, bring the soup to a boil, cover, then simmer until the broccoli is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes",
        "Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full",
        "Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree",
        "Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot",
        "Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot",
        "Return the blended soup to the pot, stir in the reserved broccoli florets, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring often",
        "Simmer until the broccoli florets are tender, 5 to 7 minutes",
        "Remove from heat, and mix in the condensed milk",
        "Serve hot"
