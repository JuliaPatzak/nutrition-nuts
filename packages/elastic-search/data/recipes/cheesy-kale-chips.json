    "summary": "An addictive alternative made with nutritional yeast. Who would have thought that leafy green chips loaded with nutrients could be so addictive? Nutritional yeast is deactivated yeast; it's not alive and has a slightly cheesy flavor which many vegans like to use as a cheese substitute. It can be found at most health food stores and some big-chain grocery stores.",
