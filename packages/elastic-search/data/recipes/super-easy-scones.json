    "summary": "This very simple scone recipe has just three ingredients! It's great for beginners and those who don't feel like fiddling with more complex scone recipes. This type of scone recipe is quite common in Australia. Serve warm with the topping of your choice. In my family, we love scones with cream and fresh strawberries, but they're great with butter and jam, or anything else you want to try.",

        "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
