    "summary": "This is an easy way to serve up a quick dinner with a lot of flavor! No need to use oil or butter to toast each side of the quesadilla, but you can if you'd like. I prefer a dry heat. Tortillas made with a corn-flour mixture work best. Serve with either Buffalo sauce, ranch dressing, or sour cream!",
