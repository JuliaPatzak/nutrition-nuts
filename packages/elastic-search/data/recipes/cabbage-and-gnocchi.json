    "summary": "This is a Polish comfort food with an Italian flare. Haluski (cabbage and noodles) is a popular budget-friendly Polish dish. I had some cabbage in the fridge and some gnocchi in my pantry so I decided to stir up some fun. I loved the way it turned out. Sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, it is even more savory and delish.",
