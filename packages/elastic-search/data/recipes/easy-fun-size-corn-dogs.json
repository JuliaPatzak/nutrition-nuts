    "summary": "Not only are these corn dogs easy and fun, but because we're doing them in the oven and not deep frying them, they are way, way less messy to make. Above and beyond all of that, I thought the timing was perfect for these, since pretty much every carnival and fair got canceled this year. Serve with mustard and ketchup.",
