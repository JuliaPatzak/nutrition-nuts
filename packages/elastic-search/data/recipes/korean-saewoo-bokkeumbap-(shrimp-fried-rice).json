    "summary": "Ever since we lost our good friend Mr.Cuckoo (the name brand of our rice cooker) a few months ago, we never have any leftover rice (which is ideal for fried rice) because our new one makes exactly four servings. And since my futile attempts at fixing Mr.Cuckoo had reached its end, the missus had to make new rice and let it cool for a few hours. Enjoy this fried rice with kimchi and other Korean side dishes.",
