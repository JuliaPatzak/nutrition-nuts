    "summary": "It must have been the subliminal beer and liquor advertising that got me, because I wasn't even thinking about Cinco de Mayo when I decided to make this milk-braised pork carnitas recipe.\u00a0The milk braising beforehand seems to give the meat a little extra succulence.\u00a0The subtle sweetness from the orange is also very nice.",
