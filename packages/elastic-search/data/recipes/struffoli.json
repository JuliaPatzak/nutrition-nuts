    "summary": "Struffoli are little balls of dough in a honey/sugar glaze, with nonpareil sprinkles. My grandma always made them for Christmas, but since she can't do it anymore, I came up with my own variation that she loves because mine are a little bit sweeter than the traditional bread-like ones. Also, they have to be formed into a tower...it's tradition.",
