    "summary": "I've always loved green curries, but until a recent visit to Al's Place I'd never thought of using fresh, sweet peas as the base. It was amazing, and after only a few bites I knew I'd steal this idea and make it my own. Sorry, Al. You can use snow peas or English peas in place of sugar snap peas, if desired.",
