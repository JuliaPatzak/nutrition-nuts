    "summary": "This recipe is actually based off a recipe called Chewy, Nutty, Healthy Granola Bars that I modified. I made for my 4-H club and they loved it so much I made it a couple more times. The raisins are just a filler because I felt the granola bars were lacking without it. The granola bars still taste good without it. Dried fruit or nuts can be substituted.",
