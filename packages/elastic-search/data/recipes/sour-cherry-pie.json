    "summary": "This is a sour cherry pie recipe that is SO simple I can put it together and get in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  The hardest thing about this pie is tracking down canned sour cherries but if you look carefully, you can find them in most grocery stores. When the pie is served, top with vanilla ice cream to add the element of sweet to the sour!",
