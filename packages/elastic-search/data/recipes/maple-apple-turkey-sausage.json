    "summary": "I love breakfast sausage, but most store-bought brands are high in calories and fat and not very diet-friendly. Try this slightly sweet version made with real maple syrup. The apples help keep the sausage moist. I like to cook up a batch on Sundays and store in the fridge for quick breakfasts all week. Take care not to overcook the patties.",
