    "summary": "Growing up I always loved my mom's broccoli and cauliflower soup! Now that I'm an adult, I've created my own version suited to my personal tastes. This is a vegetarian soup and can easily be made vegan with dairy substitutes (I use soy milk). My fiance likes reduced-fat sharp Cheddar and crackers with his soup. Enjoy!",
