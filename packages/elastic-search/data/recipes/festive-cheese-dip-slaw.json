    "summary": "Festive appetizer served in hollowed out whole red cabbage -- accompanied by corn chips! Beautiful, easy, and oh so tasty! Especially pretty for Thanksgiving and Christmas appetizer buffets. Best if made ahead at least 24 hours to let flavors blend (can refrigerate in covered container for up to one week). Even with peppers, this dip is not too spicy -- children love this dip. A winner!",
