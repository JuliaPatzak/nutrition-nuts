    "summary": "The use of short-grain sticky rice (also called glutinous rice for its texture) makes this dish creamy without the need for whole milk, cream, or butter. Cook the rice in a rice cooker, and it's even easier! You can find this variety of rice in almost any Asian market, many natural foods stores, and increasingly in the international section of mainstream supermarkets.",
