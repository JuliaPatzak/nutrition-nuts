    "summary": "Need a last-minute dish for surprise guests or dinner at a friend's house? Using pre-cooked chickpeas means making hummus in no time. Adding harissa powder leaves out the need to add any other spices and gives the hummus a nice kick of spiciness. Serve with flatbread or vegetables for an appetizer or potluck hit. Best if hummus is left to sit to allow the flavors to meld, but it can be eaten immediately. Store in the refrigerator.",
