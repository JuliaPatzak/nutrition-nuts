    "summary": "My kids and the rest of their rowing team love these wraps. At their regattas, which last from sun-up to sun-down, we moms have to feed over 100 people (50 'starving' teenagers and their families). We assemble the wraps outside on portable tables and mix the coleslaw in a huge 20 gallon storage container! Several moms form an assembly line to build the wraps. We then roll them in paper and store them in coolers for lunch and snacking all day long. They hold up well and the leftovers are still good the next day!",
