    "summary": "I like this roasted nut recipe because it doesn't use any added oil or butter - my husband likes this because it's nice and spicy!  These have become a Thanksgiving tradition at our house, and make a tasty (albeit unusual)  addition to salads, especially with the Maple Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site.",
