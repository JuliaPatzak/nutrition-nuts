    "summary": "Vanilla Oreo\u00ae cupcakes with cream cheese frosting. These were a huge hit with the kids and tasted so good. They were so much better than using a packaged cake mix. The cream cheese frosting went really well with the Oreo\u00ae's. As the birthday cake lady, this is now my go-to cream cheese frosting, and I will never buy a box cake mix again.",
