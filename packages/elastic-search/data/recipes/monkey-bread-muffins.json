    "summary": "Easy refrigerated biscuit dough monkey bread cooked in muffin pans. My son who calls these 'monkey sins' loves to be in charge of shaking the biscuit pieces with the spiced sugar. I love that I can make a few of these at a time and eat them warm without waiting for a large enough crowd to justify a tube pan full.",
