    "summary": "I visited a coffee shop in Hartford on a cold winter day and ordered their honey lemon ginger tea. It was tart, sweet, full of flavor, and warmed me from head to toe. The proprietor was nice enough to give me a rough description of her recipe. After a few tries at home, I came up with this close version.",
