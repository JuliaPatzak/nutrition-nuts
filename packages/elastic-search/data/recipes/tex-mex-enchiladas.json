    "summary": "These are authentic Tex-Mex enchiladas as taught to me by a lady originally from Chihuahua, Mexico who then added a bit of Texas. They are super easy to put together and taste incredible! Watch out though, because there is nothing low-fat about them! I like to assemble these enchiladas in the morning or night before, come home and pop them in the oven.  When cold, add 10 more minutes to the baking time. Leave out the onions for picky eaters.",
