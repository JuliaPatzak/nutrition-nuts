    "summary": "This is a copycat version of sazon, which I always use in Puerto Rican dishes. Other versions of this recipe call for only paprika or turmeric. I find adding both achieves the reddish-orange color without affecting flavor. The salt in this recipe can be reduced or omitted as many dishes call for additional salt. I prefer to omit and just add salt as needed to dishes while I'm cooking. I hope you will enjoy it!",
