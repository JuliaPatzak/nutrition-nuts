    "summary": "My husband is from Denmark, and making this traditional Danish favorite is a family affair. I make the batter, my husband does the cooking, and the kids help us make them disappear! We like to dip our aebleskivers in raspberry jam, maple syrup, and powdered sugar. The cardamom gives them that something extra. No wonder this recipe is a family favorite! Danish cooks use a long knitting needle to turn the doughnuts, but you can use a fork, too.",
