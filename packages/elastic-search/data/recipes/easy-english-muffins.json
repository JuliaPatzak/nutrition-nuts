    "summary": "This English muffin was inspired by one served at the\u00a0Model Bakery, in Napa, CA. Theirs are fried in clarified butter. I didn't actually use their recipe, since I wanted to experiment with a simpler, faster method; but if it makes you feel any better, I did cook them in clarified butter.",

    "directions": [
        "Place 1/4 cup flour, yeast, and 1/2 cup water in a mixing bowl",
        "Whisk together and set aside for about 10 minutes to see if thin layer of foam develops to ensure yeast is active",
        "Drizzle in vegetable oil; add salt, egg white, remaining 1 3/4 cup flour, and remaining 1/4 cup warm water",
        "Mix together until dough is very wet and sticky",
        "Cover",
        "Set in a warm spot and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours",
        "Pull dough gently from sides of bowl, stirring slightly, and turn out onto a well-floured rolling surface",
        "Work in just enough flour until dough is easily handled and can be cut into 6 pieces, about 1 minute",
        "Cut dough into 6 equal portions",
        "Form a seamless ball of dough, adding a pinch of flour to keep it from sticking",
        "Flatten to make thick disks",
        "Transfer dough onto a lined baking sheet sprinkled generously with cornmeal",
        "Let rise until doubled, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours",
        "Add clarified butter to skillet over medium heat",
        "Carefully transfer muffin disks to skillet",
        "Cook in batches to avoid overcrowding",
        "Brown on one side, 5 or 6 minutes",
        "Turn, and brown the other side, 5 or 6 minutes",
        "Continue turning to get muffins evenly browned and cooked through, 7 or 8 minutes total per side",
        "Transfer to a cooking rack and cool completely (this is key as you can't split the muffins unless they are cooled)",
        "Split cooled muffins with a fork, inserting tines all the way around edges so the 2 sides can be pulled apart",
        "Toast and serve with jam"
