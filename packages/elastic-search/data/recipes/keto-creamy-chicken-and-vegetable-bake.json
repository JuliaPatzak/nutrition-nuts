    "summary": "This creamy chicken and vegetable is low carb and high fat, everything you want in a keto dish! I have only made it once so far and it turned out delicious! If you have any tips or improvements, please let me know! This is a large recipe that you can easily get 8 to 10 servings from. I cook most of my keto meals this way, so we can then dish up all the leftovers into meal prep containers for lunches.",
