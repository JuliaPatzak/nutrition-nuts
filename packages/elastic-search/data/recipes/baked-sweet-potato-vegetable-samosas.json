    "summary": "Samosas are a delicious Indian treat. A crisp outside pastry with a savory filling that is either vegetarian, chicken, or lamb. This recipe is a spin on the classic samosa, using sweet potatoes instead of plain, and using pre-made pie crust so they can be baked in the oven instead of deep-fried. Chicken stock can be used for vegetable stock if you're not concerned about keeping them vegetarian-friendly.",
