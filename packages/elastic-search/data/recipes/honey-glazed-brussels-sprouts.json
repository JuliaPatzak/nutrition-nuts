    "summary": "An easy recipe for Brussels sprouts. The mix of honey and soy sauce give it an original and interesting flavor. Serve with plain rice, white or whole grain. Great with sausages or pork chops. I do not add salt and pepper, as the bouillon cube, soy sauce, and bacon give enough flavor for our taste. You may cook the sprouts in a microwave instead of boiling if you prefer.",
