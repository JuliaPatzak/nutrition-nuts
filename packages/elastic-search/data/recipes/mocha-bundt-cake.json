    "summary": "An exceptionally rich and moist chocolate cake with coffee liqueur baked in. A wonderful special dessert. A non-alcoholic version can be made by replacing the liqueur with 3/4 cup chocolate syrup mixed with 1/4 cup warm water. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. A little of the glaze may be reserved to drizzle over the topping for a nice presentation.",
