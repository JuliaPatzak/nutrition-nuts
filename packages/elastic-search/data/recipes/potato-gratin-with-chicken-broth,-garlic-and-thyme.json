        "Switch to the slicing blade and slice the potatoes (or thinly slice them with a knife)",
        "Brush a little of the garlic oil over the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch (or similar size) baking dish",
        "Make 4 layers in this order: potatoes, a generous brushing of the oil, a sprinkling of salt and pepper",
        "Slowly add broth at one corner to avoid washing off garlic and herbs",
