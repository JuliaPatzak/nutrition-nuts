    "summary": "A great (but secret) recipe for pickled eggs based upon the tradition of bluenose recipes for pickled ears from frost-bitten travelers who, due to frostbite, have lost their ears and donated them to a local Alaskan bar/pub in the area as a gag, but still available to this day (03/04/2009) as an edible bar treat to those in the know. Don't worry, these are just pickled eggs with some East Tennessee (Cocke County) tradition added. Note:  These can provide for a very foul smell from the consumer, so, provider beware!!!",
