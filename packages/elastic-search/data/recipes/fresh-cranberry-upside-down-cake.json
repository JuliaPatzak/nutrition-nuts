    "summary": "Amazingly good cranberry upside-down cake - the first time I made it, I forgot the part where you add the egg whites and it still came out good. But much better with the egg whites. My friend gave this recipe to me and I had it for a while, then I saw a bunch of fresh cranberries on sale so I decided to make it.",
