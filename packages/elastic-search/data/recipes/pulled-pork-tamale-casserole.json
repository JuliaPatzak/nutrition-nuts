    "summary": "From time to time, I cook a pork shoulder and pull the pork to be used with a few different meals. This is a recipe I came up with that may not be a traditional tamale but the ingredients meet the criteria and it is a filling comfort food. There is no reason why you couldn't substitute shredded chicken or ground beef for the pork.",
