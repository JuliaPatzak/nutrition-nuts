    "ingredients": [
        "1 (8 ounce) package low-moisture mozzarella cheese",
        "2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.\u00ae)",
        "2\u2009\u00bd cups warm water",
        "1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt, divided",
        "\u00bc cup canola oil, divided"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Shred 3 ounces of the mozzarella and cut remaining 5 ounces into 1/2-inch cubes",
        "Transfer shredded cheese to a large bowl and cubed cheese to a medium bowl",
        "Add cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, and warm water to the shredded cheese and mix to combine",
        "Set aside for 10 minutes to allow cornmeal to absorb liquid",
        "The mixture should resemble soft Play-Doh",
        "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C)",
        "With damp palms and fingers, place 1/4 cup arepa mixture into your palm and flatten into a 2 1/2-inch disk",
        "Place 3 to 4 cubes of the mozzarella into the center",
        "Gently fold edges of dough over to cover mozzarella cubes completely, patting to form a cake",
        "Repeat until all dough and cheese has been used",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat",
        "Add 3 or 4 arepas and cook until both sides are golden brown and charred in spots, 4 to 5 minutes per side",
        "Remove to a parchment-lined baking sheet and season with a pinch of the remaining salt",
        "Place in the preheated oven to keep warm",
        "Repeat with remaining oil, arepas, and salt"
