    "summary": "This Greek yogurt ranch dip is super quick and easy and low-fat or fat-free. Tailor it to your needs by choosing your favorite plain yogurt and dressing mix. The dip can be used as a dressing by tossing it into a salad, but I would not recommend watering it down for easier pouring, as this will seriously affect the flavor and consistency.",
