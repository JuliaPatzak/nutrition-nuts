    "summary": "Not only did it make a fantastic sort of Thai-like salad, I can see this dish being quite versatile as well. It was very tasty hot and would be great over rice with some of the cooked-down marinade. It would also be amazing over a big bowl of crunchy greens. Just don't skip the toasted coconut as it really does make the dish.",
