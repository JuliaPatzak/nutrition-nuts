    "summary": "This is a wonderful bacon and onion cheese spread (not dip) that is great for parties and year-round use. For Christmas, I shape this into a tree shape, on a flat tray. I sprinkle the trunk of the tree with crisp bacon and the tree itself with finely chopped green onion tops or chives. I have also shaped it into a cross for my children's confirmation parties, a Christmas stocking, and even a heart for a special Valentine's Day party. If you substitute creamy salad dressing for the mayonnaise it will not be the same. My mom tried that and it didn't turn out well. This is best made the day before and chilled. My family and friends all love this; it's one of those dishes that I have to make for every holiday and get-together.",
