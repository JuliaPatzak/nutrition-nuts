    "summary": "A delicious vegan muffin that is crisp and golden on top, dense and hearty inside, and totally addictive. This recipe is a recreation of my favourite muffins from a terrific vegan cafe in Toronto. Tasty flavour additions to this basic muffin batter include: chopped sweet potato and dates, pear and walnuts, apple and cranberries, or whatever else may tickle your fancy.",
