    "directions": [
        "Place steaks between 2 pieces of heavy plastic; pound meat about 1/4-inch thick using a meat pounder",
        "If a piece of meat breaks off, use it to patch a thinner area",
        "Place bread crumbs into a mixing bowl and stir in garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, raisins, Parmesan cheese, salt, black pepper, oregano, and egg until thoroughly combined",
        "Season steak with salt and pepper; place half the bread crumb stuffing onto the bottom 2/3 of a steak, leaving the top third of the steak without stuffing",
        "Lightly press the stuffing onto the meat and roll the steak up into a tight roll, starting from the stuffed end",
        "Tie 3 to 4 pieces of kitchen string around the roll to hold it together",
        "Trim ends of string",
        "Repeat with remaining steak and stuffing",
        "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat",
        "Pan-fry the steak rolls in the hot oil until well browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side",
        "Pour in water and dissolve pan juices and browned bits of food in the water",
        "Season steak rolls with salt and pepper; add red pepper flakes and bay leaf to the water",
        "Spread tomato sauce onto rolls",
        "Pan liquid should cover the rolls about halfway up",
        "Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes; turn rolls over and cook covered about 10 more minutes",
        "An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the stuffing should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C)",
        "Remove from pan, transfer to a platter, and let them rest for 10 minutes",
        "Raise heat to medium, bring sauce to a boil, and cook, stirring often, until sauce has reduced by half, about 10 minutes",
        "Slice the rolls crosswise",
        "Serve arranged on a little sauce and drizzle more sauce on top"
