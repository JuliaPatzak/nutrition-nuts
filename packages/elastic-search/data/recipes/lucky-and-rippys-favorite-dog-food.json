    "summary": "Due to the pet food recall I decided to submit this recipe for other dog owners looking for a soft pet food alternative. This has been reviewed by my vet and approved. This is a great healthy recipe for dogs and can be cut in half for smaller dogs. Combined with a kibble this recipe lasts about 4-5 days for 2 large Golden retrievers. Be sure that your vegetable mix contains no garlic or onions!",
