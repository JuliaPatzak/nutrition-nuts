    "summary": "I developed this brownie batter dip recipe for a friend for a bridal shower and have received requests for it ever since. Ooey-gooey, chocolaty, and very sinful. Use dip with fruit, pretzels, pound cake, plain cookies (sugar cookies). I like it with strawberries, bananas, oranges, and angel food cake. We served this with non-alcoholic champagne, red wine, and white Zinfandel for a girls' night out.",
