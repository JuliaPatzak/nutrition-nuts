    "category": "main-dish",
    "author": "Chef John",
    "summary": "This Cornish pasty is one of those rare recipes that novice cooks will find easier to make than experienced bakers. That's because to make this to its original, and very sturdy specifications, you're forced to over-mix the dough; a cardinal sin that literally gives pie makers nightmares.",
