    "summary": "I've loved Halloween ever since I was a child, and aside from the pumpkin pies and jack-o'-lanterns, I've always loved pumpkin seeds. I hope you will enjoy these as much as I did. These seeds are an altered recipe I found on the internet; by boiling them first, you allow the flavor of the mixture to soak in, while the spice adds more flavor to the seeds. These are the best pumpkin seeds I've ever had.",
