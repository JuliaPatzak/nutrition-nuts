    "directions": [
        "Combine mozzarella cheese, Shamrock Farms Cottage Cheese, jalapenos, bacon, and garlic powder in a bowl and mix well",
        "Place 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture in the middle of an egg roll wrapper",
        "Pull the bottom 1/4 up over the filling, fold in the sides, and roll up",
        "Wet the inside seam in order to make it stick",
        "Repeat with remaining cheese mixture and egg roll wrappers",
        "Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large pot",
        "You want enough oil to cover at least 3/4 of an egg roll when one is dropped in",
        "Once the oil is hot, add in egg rolls 2 or 3 at a time, turning constantly so they brown evenly",
        "Fry until deep golden brown and pull them as soon as they start to change to a louder frying sound, meaning the oil has reached the cheese",
