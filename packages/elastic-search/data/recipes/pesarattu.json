    "summary": "This is a Andhra specialty. Pesarattu is a dosa made with Pesara Pappu (moong dal). You use the moong dal with skin on and this is what gives this dosa the classic green color. Of course this dosa is high in protein and fiber. Serve it with upma rolled inside and it becomes an \u2018MLA pesarattu'. This is a heavy lentil batter and does not keep very well. Use up the batter within 2 days.",
