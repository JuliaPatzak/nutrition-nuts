    "summary": "This is a great recipe for a quick and easy entree. My wife, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant, had chicken thawing and asked me to cook since she was exhausted. She didn't have any plans so I just threw some things together and came up with this recipe. I'm sure it could be improved upon, but in a pinch it was easy and delicious.",
