    "summary": "Impress your guests with an attractive platter of curry-sauced shrimp skewered onto grilled pineapple wedges with toothpicks. This is an excellent, not-too-hard shrimp appetizer that's perfect for special occasions. It's best served at room temperature. I used approximately 1 pound of 30-40 count shrimp.  But any medium to large size shrimp will do.  You need approximately 30 shrimp. The shrimp and sauce may be cooked in advance and chilled.",
