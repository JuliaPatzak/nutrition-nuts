    "summary": "A wonderful recipe my mother used to use when I was a kid. A crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside recipe. Also works great for ling cod, snapper, or other white fish. Enjoy your halibut with what my sisters and I used to call 'pink sauce' (Miracle Whip and ketchup mixed together), a fresh spinach salad and toasted French bread.",
