    "summary": "These scones are lower in fat than standard recipes, vegan, and super full of lemony flavor! The chia seeds give it a texture similar to poppy seeds and add lots of omega 3s. The added perk is that it's a foolproof recipe. I've made this without even measuring everything exactly and they still came out great. Try adding blueberries or doubling the amount of lemon zest!",
