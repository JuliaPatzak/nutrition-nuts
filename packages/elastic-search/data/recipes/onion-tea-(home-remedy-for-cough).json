    "summary": "My German mom swears that drinking onion tea (Zwiebeltee) is the best way to get rid of a bad cough. In Germany, she sweetens it with brown \"Kandis,\" a specific kind of rock sugar, but I use honey here. It is important that you use organic onions for this home remedy as you are cooking them with their peels.",
