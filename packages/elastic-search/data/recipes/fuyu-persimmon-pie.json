    "summary": "Most persimmon pies are made as a custard pie with persimmon pulp. This one is made with sliced firm fruit and the delicious fall flavors of cinnamon and brown sugar. Make sure you are using Fuyu persimmons (short, squat-looking fruit--like an orange tomato) and not the astringent Hachiyas (large and acorn shaped).",
