    "summary": "This is an authentic Korean beef rib recipe, not the Americanized version. This is super easy and a crowd pleaser. This is for 4 pounds of ribs. I find 2 tablespoons of honey is perfect for a not-so-sweet rib. This gives you the perfect amount of tanginess. However, if you like it sweeter you can add up to 3 tablespoons.",
