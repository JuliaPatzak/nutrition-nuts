    "summary": "This spiced peach pie really brings me back to the late months of spring in Texas, when the chill's still barely in the air and the peach trees are going insane. It's a recipe I made myself with tons of input from other people and it's great for family gatherings and the like. Enjoy, y'all! Serve with good old vanilla Bluebell\u00ae and copious amounts of whipped cream, powdered sugar, fresh strawberries, and everything in between.",
