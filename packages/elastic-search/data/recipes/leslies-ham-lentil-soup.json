    "summary": "I originally called this my 'experimental lentil' soup, patching together various other lentil soup recipes. I've been making it every fall for a decade now. What's listed here is a single recipe, though I can't remember the last time I've made such a small batch. It's great for freezing in individual servings for lunches.",
