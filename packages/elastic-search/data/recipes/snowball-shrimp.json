    "summary": "Don't let the ingredients scare you. If you have a sweet tooth and love shrimp, then this will be the most amazing shrimp dish you have ever tasted. I first tried it at an Asian restaurant. I loved it so much that I looked everywhere on the internet to find a mock version. With a little tweaking I came up with this recipe that tastes just like the original. I served it to my inlaws, and now they think I am an amazing chef.",
