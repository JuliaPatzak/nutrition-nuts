    "summary": "These garlic-seasoned green beans are sauteed until crisp-tender, then topped with cheese and bacon for a delicious keto side dish. Use your favorite seasoning on the beans, or try a different cheese for variety. I like to shred my own cheese as I find it melts better than the bagged variety.",
