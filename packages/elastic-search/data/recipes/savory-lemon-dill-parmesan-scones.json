    "summary": "This is a savory, but not super-rich, scone recipe. I like the fact that I was able to whip these up with ingredients that I always have around the house. These are a nice addition to breakfast/brunch/lunch, as a side with dinner (poultry or fish would be a good companion), or for a snack. They're pretty good for entertaining if you want to make more than one batch at a time.",
