    "summary": "This hummus recipe was perfected after a weekend of experimentation. Everyone that has tried it has loved it! Several people have said it's the best they've tasted. It tastes best if the beans and lemon juice sit first, but if you're in a hurry everything can be blended together without waiting. To serve, create wells in the hummus and drizzle with olive oil and ground paprika. If desired, garnish with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, and Greek olives for a festive salad/dip with pita bread.",
