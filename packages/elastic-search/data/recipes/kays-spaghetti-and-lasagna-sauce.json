    "summary": "This sauce came from a good friend's Italian mother-in-law. It is easy, and by far the best homemade sauce I know of. Great for both spaghetti and lasagna. Pssst...the secret is the sugar! Also, as I am now vegetarian, it tastes great with out the meat! Just substitute two tablespoons olive oil for the beef.",
