    "summary": "Regardless of how you dress your wings, the key to making amazing wings is to fry them twice. I love them tossed in the dry seasoning rub listed below, since they maintain their crunchy flavor! I never understood those who chose to oven-bake their wings; it's called a guilty pleasure for a reason!  You can also season the wings with an Asian soy, BBQ, herb or traditional buffalo-style hot sauce. Serve immediately along side celery and ranch or blue cheese dressing, if desired!",
