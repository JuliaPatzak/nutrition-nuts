        "3 tablespoons white sugar for decoration"

    "directions": [
        "Place the cottage cheese in a strainer lined with cheesecloth or heavy-duty paper towels",
        "Pat dry with paper towels and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes",
        "Place apples in a bowl, and sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent browning",
        "Combine the cream cheese, drained cottage cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in the bowl of an electric mixer, and mix 1 to 2 minutes on high speed, until almost smooth",
        "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",
        "Line two baking sheets with parchment paper",
        "Cut each of the puff pastry sheets into 9 pieces; you should have 18 total",
        "Roll the pieces out, one at a time, to make 5 x 5-inch squares",
        "To ensure the pastries puff up, avoid using too much pressure or rolling over the edges of the dough",
        "Place a square in front of you so that it looks like a diamond",
        "Spoon a generous amount of cheese filling down the middle of each square, leaving 1/4 inch of room at the top and bottom edges",
        "Fan out 4-5 slices of apple down the center of each cheese-filled square",
        "Bring the left and right corners together to meet in the center and pinch to seal",
        "Transfer the Danish to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pastries",
        "Sprinkle sugar over each bundle and bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes"
