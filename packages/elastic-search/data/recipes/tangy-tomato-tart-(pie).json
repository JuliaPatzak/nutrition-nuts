    "summary": "I am an American living in France and have had a few experiences with making a traditional 'Tarte Tomate' recipe. I have never quite gotten it right, but this weekend I decided to break the rules and make it how I thought it would taste best, and it worked for me! Even if you don't usually love tomatoes I would recommend giving this a try. If you can use heritage (coeur de boeuf) tomatoes, do it! That is what I used today and it was great. I think the quality of the tomatoes will make a difference for the recipe.",
