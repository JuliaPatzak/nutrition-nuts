        "Make 2 slashes on the skin side down to the bone in the thigh section and 1 in the leg section of each leg quarter",

        "Cover and marinate in refrigerator 4 to 12 hours",
        "Transfer chicken to paper-towel-lined sheet pan to drain slightly",

        "Turn chicken and cook another 6 to 7 minutes",
        "Continue cooking and turning until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 more minutes",
