    "summary": "This is a traditional Italian appetizer that is, essentially, liver pate served on toasted, rustic bread.  This is a nice recipe for cocktail parties and wine tastings. For vegetarians in attendance, you can also prepare a version with finely chopped (and drained) herbed tomatoes as it is equally delicious. You can serve the dish hot or cold on toasted Italian bread.",
