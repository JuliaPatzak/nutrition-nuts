    "summary": "These are amazing and nothing amazing is ever easy; keep that in mind when you undertake this recipe. Try to avoid tasting them before you're ready to serve because you may end up eating them all and your guests will be left with only marinara and pasta. I make this recipe as written, then I freeze half of it when combined as it makes about 40-50, 1 1/2-inch meatballs (enough to feed Sicily.)",
