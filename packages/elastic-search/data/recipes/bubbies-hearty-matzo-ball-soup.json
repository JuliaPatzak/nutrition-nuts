    "summary": "This recipe has been in our family for generations. Some family members say it started with our great-great-grandmother Bubbie Rose.  My husband, her great-great-grandson, has put his own twist on it by adding extra vegetables and fresh dill which we think sets this soup above the rest. This soup is so good, there's no reason to wait until Passover to enjoy it.",
