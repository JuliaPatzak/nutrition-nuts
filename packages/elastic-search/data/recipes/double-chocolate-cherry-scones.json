    "summary": "These are so decadent tasting, but surprisingly have very little chocolate! The bonus they cook rather quick! I use black onyx cocoa powder from the Savory Spice Shop\u00ae- it allows for a much deeper, darker, and richer chocolate taste that regular Dutch processed cocoa powder just doesn't have.",
