    "summary": "This is a quick and easy chocolate cake you can cook in the microwave in 2 minutes.  And it tastes great.  Really!  The consistency is dense and cakey.  It would go well with chocolate (or your favorite) chips, nuts, or served warm with hot fudge.  This cake, 'born' out of a pregnancy craving, worked out amazingly!",
