    "summary": "Not your average chili. Because this is a chili and not a stew or soup, it is deliberately under-watered. I would add 1 cup of water if you are planning on leaving the house while this cooks, especially on High. And if you are using frozen chicken, allow an extra hour to reach the correct consistency. Also, you may need to add salt depending on how salty the broth you are using is. If you like your chili spicier, I would add a lot more jalapenos. I think I used about 3 tablespoons on a half recipe of this. For a more intense cumin flavor, use cumin seeds instead or add the cumin at the end.",
