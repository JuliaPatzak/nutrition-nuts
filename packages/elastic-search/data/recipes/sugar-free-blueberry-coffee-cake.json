    "summary": "A fabulous blueberry coffee cake with a crumb topping. This recipe is one from a local B&B that I replaced all the sugar with substitutes because I have diabetes. I have received all praise and 'I can't believe it is sugar free.'  The sugar can be put back in if you want. Either way it is wonderful.",
