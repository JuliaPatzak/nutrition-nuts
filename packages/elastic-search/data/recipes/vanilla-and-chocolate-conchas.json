    "summary": "Conchas are better known as pan dulce or Mexican sweet bread. I scanned the Internet for the best conchas recipe and couldn't find one. So I took it upon myself to take pieces of 3 different recipes and put them together, with a couple alterations of course! Many recipes you see all have butter in the dough, but this recipe is traditional and uses lard. It will leave you with light pillows of sweetness that you will dream about while you sleep.",
