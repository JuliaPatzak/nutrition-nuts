    "summary": "There's nothing more satisfying than home cookin', and there's nothing more home cookin' than a thick, hearty soup on a fall or winter's day. This is a very basic, traditional soup using a ham bone and the trimmings from a baked ham, pre-sliced or not. If you bake your own hams but have been throwing out the bone, you're missing out on something very special!",
