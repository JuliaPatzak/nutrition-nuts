    "summary": "This take on traditional chicken salad has received rave reviews wherever it's been served. I've even been able to convert my husband, who won't come within 10 feet of traditional chicken salad, into a \"more please\" kinda guy when I serve these curried chicken lettuce wraps for dinner! Also makes great leftovers as it tastes even better after a day or two!",
