    "summary": "As a child, my husband loved going to his Aunt Kathy's in hopes that she would be making his favorite old-fashioned potato donuts. These are light and flavorful. They are best served fresh and warm and enjoyed with a cup of hot coffee, tea, or cocoa. You can leave them plain, dust them with powdered sugar, white sugar and cinnamon, or drizzle them with a glaze.",
