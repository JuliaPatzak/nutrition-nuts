    "summary": "I have loved tri-tip (bottom sirloin) ever since my father-in-law in Santa Barbara introduced me to it.  Tri-tip is a cut of meat that first became popular in Santa Maria, on the central coast of California. I love the taste of the original Santa Maria rub, but this is even better.",
