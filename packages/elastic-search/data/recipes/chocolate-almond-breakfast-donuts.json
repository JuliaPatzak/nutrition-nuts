    "summary": "I'm showing you how to make gluten-free, grain-free, low-carb, high-protein donuts that are healthy enough to eat for breakfast, without all the guilt and shame. You might think \"that sounds great, but they must taste terrible like all 'healthy' donuts,\" but that's the thing--they don't! They taste really good, especially if they're covered in chocolate. These donuts may be topped with melted dark chocolate and garnished with toasted coconut, chopped almonds, or dark chocolate chips if desired.",

        "Add almond flour, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder; mix everything together thoroughly with a spatula until all the almond flour is incorporated and you've achieved a very thick batter",
        "Transfer batter into a pastry bag, or a plastic zip-top bag with one of the corners cut off",
        "Pipe the batter evenly into the prepared donut pan",
        "Dip a finger in water and smooth the tops of the batter to even out",
        "Tap the pan on a work surface a few times to settle the batter even more",
