        "Heat the beer in a saucepan over low heat until it reaches 110 degrees F (45 degrees C)",
        "Combine the warm beer, sugar, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt in a bowl",
        "Sprinkle the yeast on top, and let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam",

        "Add the yeast mixture, then select the dough cycle",
