    "summary": "I was watching King of the Hill, Peggy mentions making Frito\u00ae pie. My husband looks at me and says see if you can find something like that on the internet. Looking at other people's recipes on other sites, I decided to make my own version of Frito Pie. While Hank Hill prefers Wolf Brand Chili, I made my own. :) Hope you enjoy!",
