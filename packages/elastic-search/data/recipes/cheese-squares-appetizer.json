    "summary": "This is a wonderful baked appetizer blending the tastes of Cheddar cheese and jalapeno peppers. The amount of jalapenos used can easily be adjusted to personal taste, although baking does take a lot of the burn out of the peppers. I've made this several times and I never have leftovers.  My husband wishes I would make these for him every day.  I don't recommend doubling the recipe; make multiple batches instead.",
