    "summary": "Ever since a trip to Ireland in 2001 I have wanted to recreate a leek soup I enjoyed in a small village restaurant. This is what I came up with and even my husband thinks I nailed it. My kids will eat this because it is smooth and they are not turned off by any particular ingredient.",
