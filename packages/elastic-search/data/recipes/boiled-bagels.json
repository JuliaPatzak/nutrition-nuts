    "ingredients": [
        "4\u2009\u00bc cups all-purpose flour",
        "2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast",
        "1\u2009\u00bd cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)",
        "3 tablespoons white sugar",
        "1 tablespoon salt",
        "1 tablespoon white sugar"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "In large bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour and yeast",
        "Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar and salt together, and add to the dry ingredients",
        "Beat with a mixer for half a minute at a low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean",
        "Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes",
        "Then, by hand, mix in enough flour to make a moderately stiff dough",
        "Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (8-10 minutes)",
        "Cover, let rest for 15 minutes",
        "Cut into 12 portions, shape into smooth balls",
        "Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape",
        "Cover, let rise 20 minutes",
        "Meanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling",
        "Put 1 tablespoon of sugar in it, mix it around a bit",
        "Reduce to simmering",
        "When the bagels are ready, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water, and cook 7 minutes, turning once",
        "Drain them",
        "Place on a greased baking sheet, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes",
        "Remove from oven, eat hot or cold",
        "Broiling option: For a glossier surface, place raised bagels on an ungreased baking sheet prior to boiling them",
        "Broil them five inches from heat for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes on each side",
        "Then put them into the hot water to be boiled as above",
        "Note: do not bake broiled bagels as long as non-broiled ones, 25 minutes should be long enough"
