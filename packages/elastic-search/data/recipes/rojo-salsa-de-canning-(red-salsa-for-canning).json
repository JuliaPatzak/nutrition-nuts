    "summary": "This recipe was given to me by a very dear friend; we are godparents to each other's children. I remember when we were very young wives trying to can salsa all by ourselves. We laughed and had so much fun making our mess. This salsa has no vinegar in it, like several canning recipes call for. I am dedicating this recipe to the memory of my friend Toni.",
