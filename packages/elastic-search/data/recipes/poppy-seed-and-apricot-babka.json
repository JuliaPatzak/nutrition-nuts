    "summary": "Ever since I tasted grey poppy seeds in Austria (a specialty from an area called Waldviertel) they are my favorite kind but but they are hard to find; black poppy seeds work just as well. Poppy seeds turn rancid very quickly so grind them just before using, unless you have a source for freshly ground poppy seeds. Use only high-quality, soft dried apricots. Blenheim apricots which are grown in California are hands-down the best.",

        "Stir in apricots and cardamom and let cool, then refrigerate until using",
        "Whisk cream cheese, 2 tablespoons sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth",

        "Add egg, sugar, vanilla, and yeast mixture",
        "Knead for 4 to 5 minutes on low speed, until the dough is elastic and detaches from the bowl",
        "Drizzle with a little vegetable oil and turn the dough over so it is lightly oiled all around",
        "Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and a large plate and let rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes",
        "Punch down the dough and roll it out on a silicone baking mat to a square about 1/4 inch thick",

        "Pinch the seems together with your fingertips to seal",
        "Place the roll on a large plate and refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm it up",
