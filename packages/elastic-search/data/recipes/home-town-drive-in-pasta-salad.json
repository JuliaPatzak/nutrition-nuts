    "summary": "A small drive-in dairy bar in our town which has been closed for some time used to make this...my kids missed it. I remembered they had the ingredients posted to a board in the drive-in for some reason, so I worked on trying to get it the way they prepared it. It's finally right and I thought I would share it. We like this at room temperature, but it certainly can be refrigerated.",
