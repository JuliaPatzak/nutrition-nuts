    "summary": "Garlic, lemon, and the nutty bitterness of broccoli rabe are a wonderful combination. I'm deathly allergic to tree nuts, but this Italian side dish smelled so good the first time I encountered it, I called my doctor the next day to find out if pine nuts are actually nuts. He didn't know. I went back and ate it anyway. Turns out pine nuts are seeds, by the way.",
