    "summary": "Serve this with crudites to keep it light; celery and carrot sticks are the perfect vessel for scooping up the Buffalo goodness! You can even add some baked chips to the table, e.g. baked pita chips work great. I minced some of the celery leaf for garnish for a little color. Enjoy!",
