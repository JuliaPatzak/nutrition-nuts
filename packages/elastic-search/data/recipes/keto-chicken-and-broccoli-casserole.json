    "summary": "Sometimes, I overestimate what my family will eat. No worries, a casserole will help use up those leftovers! You may use any combination of cooked chicken--dark and white, all dark, or all white. I used chicken thighs. Add some leftover cooked broccoli and some pantry items, and you are there.  It's a 'keto' recipe, to boot!",
