    "summary": "At 9 weeks pregnant with full-on morning sickness and food aversion, I was craving something with black beans, chicken and tomatoes, but couscous sounded good too. After a search online, nothing popped up so I created this. Turned out pretty good. Enjoy! Next time I'm going to add cream cheese and mix it in. I bet it'll be even better.",
