    "summary": "Moist delicious way to use up excess sweet potatoes or yams after the holidays. This is so delicious that it disappeared within minutes. Wrap in aluminum foil to keep the moisture in. Ideally, refrigerate the loaves for 2 hours or more before serving; or can be frozen and served later. Just remove from freezer and allow to thaw while still covered at room temperature for about 4 hours before serving.",
