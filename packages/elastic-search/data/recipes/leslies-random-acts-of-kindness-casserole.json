    "summary": "I make this easy-peasy, one-pan pasta dish for new parents or stressed-out friends and it always seems to make the evenings go a little more smoothly. The smoked salmon and green pea combo plays up the salty-sweet flavors loads of people crave, and the lemon zest/breadcrumb topping brightens up what could be an over-the-top rich dish.",
