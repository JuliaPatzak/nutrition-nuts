    "summary": "This is my husband's recipe that was handed down to him by his grandmother. His grandmother stated that you must use Farmer John\u00ae sausage and bacon drippings or it would not taste as delicious as hers. It was never written down, just a pinch of this and a handful of that. I finally got him to measure everything and this is the result.",
