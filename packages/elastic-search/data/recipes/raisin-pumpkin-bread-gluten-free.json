    "summary": "I have to eat gluten free. My husband doesn't have to but he does. When I make the food homemade it is so much like what we have always known that it isn't a hardship. This is a lovely, moist pumpkin raisin bread. I use Better Batter\u00ae Gluten-Free all-purpose flour. I measure by weight and that has made all the difference! I refuse to use bean flour mixes; who wants bean flavor in their sweets? Let it cool completely or it will not hold together. Once it is cooled you can slice and serve. Enjoy!",
