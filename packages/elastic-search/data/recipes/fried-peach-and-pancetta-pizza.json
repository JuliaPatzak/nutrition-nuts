    "summary": "Growing up, I always loved when my family made pizza from scratch, but what I loved even more was what came after the meal. Any extra dough and scraps were rolled out, left to rise, fried, and sprinkled with sugar to create a simple, but delicious donut-like treat.\u00a0Here we're doing a savory twist, using the same technique to make a pizza featuring ricotta, pancetta, and peaches. Garnish with extra sprig of thyme if desired.",
