    "summary": "Put this in front of the guys during the next game and watch it disappear! It's easy to control the heat by removing the seeds and ribs (the whitish membrane inside the pepper) before dicing to result in a dip that is mild, medium, or hot and spicy, to suit your taste. For a mild dip, remove all seeds and ribs. For a very spicy dip, leave all the seeds and ribs intact. Serve with sliced sourdough baguettes.",
