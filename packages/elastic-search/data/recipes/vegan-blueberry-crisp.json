    "summary": "This blueberry crisp is simple and delicious! The perfect balance of sweet and tart. The original recipe used mayonnaise but I have substituted Vegenaise\u00ae, which is a vegan alternative made from vegetable oils. It is available at some health food stores. You wouldn't guess that there is such an unusual ingredient! Best served with vanilla ice cream, or your favorite vegan alternative!",
