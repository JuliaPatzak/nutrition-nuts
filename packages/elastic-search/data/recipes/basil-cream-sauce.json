    "summary": "After a mad search on the net for a recipe for this sauce I had to create my own. This can be reheated in the microwave without the usual cream sauce defects. I just love the light green color and how well it displays over tri color or regular pasta, salmon and grilled chicken. I have been putting this on everything.",
