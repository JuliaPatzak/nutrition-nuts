    "summary": "This is a basic garlic oil that can be used as a dipping sauce for bread, the oil half of an Italian vinaigrette, or as the base for Mediterranean-style cooking. If you use it for the latter, though, you may want to omit the herbs and add the extra-virgin olive oil unless your pan is non-stick or you do not mind burned little flecks of oregano and parsley.",
