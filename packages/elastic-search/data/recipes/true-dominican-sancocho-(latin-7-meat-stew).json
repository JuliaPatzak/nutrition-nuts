    "summary": "My fiance is from the D.R. and his mother has made me some amazing food! The first time she made sancocho I fell in love with it. It is often made with 7 different meats for a special festivity or holiday. I have simplified the meats in my version, but don't be afraid to use many kinds; this is my mimicked recipe. Great by itself or served the traditional way over rice. Super filling and even better the next day.",
