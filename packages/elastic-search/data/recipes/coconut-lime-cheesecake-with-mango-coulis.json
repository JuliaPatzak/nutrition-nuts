    "summary": "This tropical-inspired cheesecake features a ginger-coconut crust and two divine layers topped off with a fresh mango coulis. I like to make a coconut cream by adding coconut extract to whipped cream for topping the cheesecake. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of toasted coconut, for even more flavor.",

        "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)",

        "Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)",
        "Beat the softened cream cheese in mixer bowl until smooth",
        "With beater set to medium-low, slowly pour the condensed milk into the bowl, mixing only until just blended, stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary",

        "Pour about half of the cream cheese batter into a separate bowl",
        "Stir the lime juice and lime zest into the portion in the new bowl; pour the batter over the crust in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer",

        "Refrigerate until completely chilled",
        "Prepare mango coulis by pureeing the mango with sugar until smooth",
        "If too thick, add a teaspoon of water at a time, using just enough to make pourable",
