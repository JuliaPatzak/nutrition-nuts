    "summary": "This is an easy vegan falafel using dried garbanzo beans and ingredients you already have in your cupboard. No eggs or bread crumbs either as filler--just tasty falafel! Serve with tzatziki and typical falafel fare such as lettuce, tomato, and cucumber. It's not much more work than using canned beans, but the taste is phenomenal and authentic.",
