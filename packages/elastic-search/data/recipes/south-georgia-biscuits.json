    "summary": "These are traditional hand-formed South Georgia biscuits as made by my family for generations.  Unlike most recipes, these biscuits are formed entirely by hand, not rolled and cut.  Once you master the technique, you can make them very quickly and will find the texture and appearance to be much better than rolled biscuits.",
