    "summary": "I have always just called these chorizo steamed clams, 'Spanish Clams,' since it seems like there's some variation of this on every Spanish restaurant menu I've ever seen. Sometimes they use beer, or white wine, or sherry; and many varieties of clams can be used. But the common denominator is the spicy, Spanish-style chorizo. I like to serve steamed clams with grilled bread.",
