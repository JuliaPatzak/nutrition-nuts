    "summary": "This shrimp scampi recipe varies from the typical one as there are sun dried tomatoes in the recipe. This is like eye candy when presented in a warmed ramekin dish with some chopped parsley and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese added to the top.  Hubby says this is his favorite scampi and better than any he gets at an upscale restaurant.",
