    "summary": "I bought a similar spread at the grocery store a while back, and I thought that I could do it better and cheaper myself.  You can use imitation crab, instead of the real thing if you like.  I use cooked and frozen artichoke hearts or you can buy fresh artichokes, and cook the hearts up yourself.",
