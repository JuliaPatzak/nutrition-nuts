    "summary": "I improvised this salmon casserole with items I had on hand in my pantry. I've never been big on casseroles (if you've had my mom's cooking, you'd understand why), but they are definitely an easy way to use up items that would otherwise be sitting in the pantry forever. This recipe is simple enough; feel free to add or supplement as you see fit!",
