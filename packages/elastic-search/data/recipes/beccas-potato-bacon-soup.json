    "summary": "This creamy potato soup is good any time of the year, but especially in cold weather months. It reheats well and can be made without bacon or cheese. This is filling enough to be served as a main dish, but also makes a nice side soup if served in smaller portions. Feel free to add your own ingredients: other vegetables, seasonings, different cheeses, etc. When serving, some options for garnish are chopped green onions, additional crumbled bacon, shredded cheese, and parsley. Enjoy!",
