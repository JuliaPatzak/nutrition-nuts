    "summary": "Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, and honey glaze. Unlike most similar recipes, this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. The fresh ingredients are the star here: Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients! I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.",
