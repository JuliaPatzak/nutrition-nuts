    "summary": "I wanted to make some sort of crostata or galette-type, free-form tart which I've done successfully in the past (and have\u00a0the video to prove it). But instead of using standard pie crust dough, I decided to try something a little more rustic and savory, using spelt flour and olive oil. I knew this would pair beautifully with the sweet fruit and tangy cheese, but it ended up being way too crumbly. So, I just crumbled it into the bottom of a shallow ramekin and the rest is history.",
