    "summary": "This is a favorite recipe originally made by my mother with chicken on-the-bone and homemade broth cooked over a stove. I have found I don't have the time to start from scratch and that this version tastes just as good with less fuss! You can substitute freshly cooked chicken, if desired. You can line the slow cooker with a slow cooker liner for easy clean-up.",
