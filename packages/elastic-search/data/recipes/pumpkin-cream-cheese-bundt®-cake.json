    "summary": "This is more of a maple-pumpkin bread with a cream cheese center, than it is a true cake; but it's delicious nevertheless. It's not overly sweet and goes great with a cup of coffee. It also seems to taste better the next day, as the spices seem to come out a little more the longer the cake sits.",
