    "summary": "I came up with this recipe, because simply simmering sausages in beer and onions tasted weak. I was looking for a more intense beer flavor with a little bite, and this is it. A very satisfying dish if you crave German flavor that's Americanized. We love this dish served on potato rolls with spicy hot German mustard, Swiss cheese, and ice cold beer on the side.",
