    "summary": "Wonton Noodle soup is a traditional Cantonese meal served as a hearty breakfast or lunch.  These wontons, made from seasoned pork and shrimp, are the actual dumplings served with egg noodles and chicken broth. 'Dashi' - or fish flakes - is an optional ingredient, but adds wonderful flavor. If you feel daring, you may try making your own dashi from a fish purchased whole.",
