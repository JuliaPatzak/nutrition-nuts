    "summary": "This is one of my favorite things to make once the weather gets a chill in the air. It's great for cheese-lovers (like myself) and works great as leftovers or at dinner parties! Truffle oil has by far been one of the best culinary purchases I have made. One little bottle has lasted me a year, and can be used with so many things, like this recipe. Top with a pinch of truffle salt!",
