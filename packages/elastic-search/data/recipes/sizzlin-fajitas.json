    "summary": "These fajitas are my husband's favorite quick-and-easy dinner. They are so tasty! If you do not have the time to marinate the meat for 2 or more hours, just leave it out at room temperature, keeping the bag zipped tightly for about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve with sour cream, Cheddar cheese or Monterey Jack cheese, and lime wedges.",
