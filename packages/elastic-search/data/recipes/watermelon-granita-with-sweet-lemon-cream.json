It is sure to surprise the palate with its blend of sweet and tart, crunchy and creamy. The granita can be stored in the freezer and prepared days or weeks ahead. A simple dish to prepare, the granita can be served with or without the cream. Serve granita and labneh cream with a drizzle of honey and a sprig of mint.",
