    "summary": "Though the name of this recipe is ordinary, the flavor is anything but, thanks to its use of rendered sausage fat, which makes everything it touches taste meatier, including the chicken breasts and mushroom pan sauce. Introduce this ultra-forgiving technique to any friend who's intimidated by cooking to prove just how easy it is to pull off a gorgeous dinner.",
