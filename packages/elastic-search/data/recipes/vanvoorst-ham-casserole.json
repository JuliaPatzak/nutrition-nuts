    "summary": "This came from a long line of VanVoorst women from rural Illinois. It's a goodie to pass along and works great with leftover ham as well as ham steak! We serve it up with garlic bread and green beans or broccoli. You may also top with Parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs to change it up.",
