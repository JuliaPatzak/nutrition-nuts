        "Squeeze the liquid from the block of tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing it with a weight",
        "Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)",

        "Mix with a fork",

        "Slice the slab of tofu into pieces that are approximately 1/2-inch thick and approximately 2 inches in length and width",
