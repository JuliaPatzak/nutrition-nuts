    "summary": "They say your greatest strength is also your biggest weakness; the same starchy sweetness that makes this tuber such a popular holiday side dish also can lead to palate fatigue. That's why I've enlisted bacon, lime, jalapeno, green onions, and sharp Cheddar to make these twice-baked sweet potatoes more addictive than in any Thanksgiving past. You can prep them ahead of time and then bake when you're ready to serve.",
