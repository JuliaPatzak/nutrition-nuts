    "summary": "If you like Indian flavors, this is a fun twist on an old favorite. I was in the mood to make tuna salad but wanted something different, and when I didn't find a recipe that interested me, I made one up based on bhel puri chaat. The chutneys called for might not be standard issue in your pantry, but the store-bought ones do keep a long time and add a lot of flavor with no fat. The key to this recipe is the balance of flavors and textures. You need sweet and spicy, crunchy and soft. It's delicious and of course, it was easy. Serve on toasted naan, in sandwich wraps, tortillas, open-faced on toasted bread, or over greens as a salad.",
