    "summary": "This is an easy recipe for cauliflower cheese but it's pretty versatile. You can use the cheese sauce with any vegetables you have handy. I often put a layer of cooked kale or broccoli on the bottom, then arrange the cooked cauliflower florets on top. You can change the flavor of the sauce by adding different cheeses you might have in your fridge. It takes a bit of elbow work to make the sauce but it's worth it. This is delicious served with roast beef or lamb.",
