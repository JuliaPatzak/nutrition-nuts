    "summary": "These are very easy and quick to make.  To make them even faster, you can make the dough the night before, cover and store in refrigerator overnight. That way in the morning all you have to do is heat your oil, cook and serve.  Look like small puffed doughnut holes. I like them tossed in a plastic bag with cinnamon and sugar.",
