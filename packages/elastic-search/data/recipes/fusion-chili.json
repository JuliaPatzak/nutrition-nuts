    "summary": "A true fusion of 'Tex' and 'Mex' style chili. I've made this recipe dozens of times, and it is great.  Each bite slowly delivers a sweet flavor followed by dry heat afterwards.  It takes a while to prepare, but well worth it. You can use any type of beans you like, and try different dried chile varieties.",
