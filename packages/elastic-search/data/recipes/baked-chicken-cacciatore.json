    "summary": "This baked chicken cacciatore was inspired by a lonely can of stewed tomatoes that were in the pantry. This is simple to make and sooooo good! I love to serve this with mashed potatoes, but it also goes great with rice or pasta. We like it just as is, but feel free to \"spice it up\" any way you wish.",
