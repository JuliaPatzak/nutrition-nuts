    "summary": "I created this sandwich one weekend when I couldn't decide whether to have turkey, roast beef, or ham. This sandwich has all three! You can substitute Italian roast beef for the regular roast beef to take this sandwich to another level. Most supermarket delis carry the Italian, you just have to ask. Also, the order of the ingredients is important for all of the tastes to blend properly.",
