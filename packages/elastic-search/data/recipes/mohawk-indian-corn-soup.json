    "summary": "On the Akwesasne Reservation where I grew up I have fond memories of corn soup always being on the stove on New Year's Eve. Friends and family would stop in and have a bowl or two and celebrate the end of the year. I continue this tradition with my own family now. Use canned Indian corn instead of hominy if available.",
