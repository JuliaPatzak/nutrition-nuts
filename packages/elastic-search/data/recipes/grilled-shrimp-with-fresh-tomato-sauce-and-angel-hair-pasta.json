    "summary": "Everything except the pasta is done on the grill in this quick and delicious recipe. Shrimp bathe in a yummy marinade while the rest of the ingredients are prepped. Angel hair pasta cooks in about 5 minutes, so have it ready and out of the way, before you go to the grill. Once you get the ingredients outside, things will go very quickly! A Caesar salad and some hot garlic bread would be great sides!",
