    "summary": "I take bat wings to Halloween parties, angel wings to Christmas parties, and so on. They are just fab and easy with only 3 ingredients. My boyfriend loves to tweak this recipe. However, I just love this simple basic recipe and I hope you do, too. It's better if you can marinate this overnight. I put it in gallon sealable bag and keep in refrigerator then pour in pan the next day.",
