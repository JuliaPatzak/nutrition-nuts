    "summary": "I found this in an inherited recipe box dated 1936. It originally called for 2 tablespoons fat, but I have substituted margarine or shortening with good results. I do not recommended making this recipe in a bread machine. If necessary, one tablespoon of active dry yeast can be substituted for the compressed yeast in this recipe.",
