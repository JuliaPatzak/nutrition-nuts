    "summary": "This recipe is excellent served for breakfast with fruit or at lunch or dinnertime with a salad. This recipe makes two 9 inch pies. The reason for this is because if you only make one you will hate yourself the next day when there are no leftovers. The quiche microwaves well the next day. In fact most people say that the flavors have blended better on the second day... If in the strange case that you are filled up with one pie, this is a great gift to give a friend or relative, or if you are stingy...it freezes well with tin foil.",
