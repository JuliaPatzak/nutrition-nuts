    "summary": "I am lucky enough to live in a small community whose school district still allows us to send home-baked goods with our children. My daughter is in 7th grade now, but her classmates still beg her to have her mom send this special treat. It's a beautiful quick bread your family, friends, and all the neighbor children will love.",
