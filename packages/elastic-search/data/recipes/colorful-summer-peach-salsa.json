    "summary": "It may sound strange, but this fruity summer salsa is really good, and quite beautifully colored! I was hoping to make peach salsa one night and was improvising and experimenting and came up with this variation featuring peaches, cucumber and coconut. I recommend making this dish day-of, it's much prettier when it's fresh.",
