    "summary": "This recipe is delicious, moist and a great way to use up all the zucchini that your garden produces. Enjoy! Shred the zucchini first and let it sit in a colander to drain while putting the other ingredients together. I use very large zucchini from my garden and cut out all the seeds. Use left over shredded zucchini to make fritters. Optional additions include pecans, walnuts, dried cherries, raisins, or chocolate chips.",
