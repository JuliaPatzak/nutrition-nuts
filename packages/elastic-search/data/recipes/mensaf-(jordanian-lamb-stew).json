    "summary": "It's hard to find the whey needed to make 'real' mensaf. It comes in a rocklike form and is diluted and used in place of the jameed in this recipe. Even without it, this recipe comes close to the national dish of Jordan. It is made on special occasions and traditionally eaten with your hands. Spices, onions, garlic, and butter can also be added to season the goat's milk sauce.",
