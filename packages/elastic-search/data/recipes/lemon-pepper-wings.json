    "summary": "Yet another great variation on the ever-popular tailgating and sports-bar snack and very simple and easy to make. I have tried this with several brands of lemon pepper seasonings and found I actually liked the cheapest one the most. It was a tad twangier than the others and was more suited to my liking. I found it at my local food store in the seasoning section. I also tend to lean towards a lemon pepper seasoning that includes a white pepper and less black.",
