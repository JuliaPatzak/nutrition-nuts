    "summary": "This recipe was given to me by a friend years ago and she told me she used it for her strawberry shortcake. It is absolutely heavenly and my niece loves to eat it plain. It is just a good basic recipe--only your imagination limits what you can do with it. It is just a good ole southern recipe and super simple. Awesome with fresh strawberries.",
