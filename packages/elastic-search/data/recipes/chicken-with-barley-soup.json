    "summary": "This is a high-protein, high-fiber, and low-fat recipe that is very filling. I usually double the recipe so I have plenty of leftovers. The soup freezes well. This soup comes out very thick; if you like a thinner soup, add more water or reduce the barley to 1/2 cup. This soup recipe is very flexible. Adjust amount of veggies and seasonings to your family's taste.",
