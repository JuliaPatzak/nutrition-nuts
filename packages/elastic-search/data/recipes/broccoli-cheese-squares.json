    "summary": "So incredibly good you will not believe how easy they are to make. A family secret recipe that leaves lots of room for interpretation. We eat these a lot in the summer for dinner with a salad and a loaf of good bread. YUM! But be sure that if adding cooked ingredients, allow them to cool a bit before adding milk and eggs so they don't start to scramble. Eat lukewarm for best flavor or warm.",
