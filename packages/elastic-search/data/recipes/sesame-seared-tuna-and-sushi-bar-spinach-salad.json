    "summary": "This recipe is dedicated to the other side of the sushi bar menu, where after you work your way through the nigiri and sushi rolls, you discover things like tuna tataki and cold, Japanese-style spinach salad. While I can't promise authenticity, I can promise this is fast and simple to make--and I think, extremely delicious.",
