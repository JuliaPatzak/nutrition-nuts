        "Prepare beef: Trim off excess fat with a sharp knife",
        "Fold thin tip end under to approximate the thickness of the rest of the roast",
        "Tie with butcher's twine, then keep tying the roast with twine every 11/2 to 2 inches (to help the roast keep its shape)",
        "Snip silverskin with scissors to keep roast from bowing during cooking",
        "Then, mix oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, pepper and salt; rub over roast to coat",
        "Set meat aside",
        "Either build a charcoal fire in half the grill or turn all gas burners on high for 10 minutes",
        "Lubricate grate with an oil-soaked rag using tongs",
        "Place beef on hot rack and close lid; grill until well-seared, about 5 minutes",
        "Turn meat and close lid; grill until well-seared on second side, another 5 minutes",
        "Move meat to the charcoal grill's cool side, or turn off burner directly underneath the meat and turn remaining one or two burners (depending on grill style) to medium",
