    "summary": "A homemade alternative to the Durkee\u00ae brand. I use these for casserole recipes. I will never buy store-bought French fried onions again. This recipe makes a lot! I often just use one onion and about 1/2 cup of milk and 1 cup of flour with seasonings if I just want to use them for one dish. Warning: You may have to make what the original recipe calls for because they are so yummy and you won't be able to stop eating them!",
