    "summary": "Although 'creamy' tells us it probably isn't healthy, these combined healthy ingredients provide a creamy texture that I just can't resist. After wanting to recreate a lentil salad I had from a local market, I realized I had made a salad more delicious than I had intended and it was nothing like I had been attempting to make. This salad is great as a side dish, a main salad, served on top of brown rice, or on top of a bed of lettuce.",
