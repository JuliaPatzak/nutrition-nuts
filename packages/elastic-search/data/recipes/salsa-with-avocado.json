    "summary": "This is a very easy recipe that always gets rave reviews and many recipe requests. A co-worker who is from Mexico shared it with me. It's very quick to prepare, and can be served immediately. I like to make it at least an hour before serving, so the flavors can marry. The key ingredient is the El Pato\u00ae Tomato Sauce (yellow can), which can be found in the ethnic section of your supermarket. You may have to go to a Mexican market if you can't find it at your usual supermarket. Serve with tortilla chips. Leftovers are great the next day, too!",
