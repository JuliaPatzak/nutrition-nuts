    "summary": "This recipe was shared with me by a dear friend many years ago. It has been a favorite ever since. As I've tweaked it to my own taste, you may find it interesting to do the same. Some like to use ranch dressing instead of mayo, or dill pickles instead of sweet. Just as with a tossed salad, you may add your favorite ingredients like broccoli, green peppers, sweet onions, or olives. Have fun!",
