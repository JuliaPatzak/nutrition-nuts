    "summary": "This is a traditional Chinese sweet rice recipe that is usually served for the Chinese New Year. This recipe was handed down to me from my dad who liked to eat this alone as a main dish, so it's a little heartier than most other sweet rice recipes. For those of you who know what Chinese sweet rice is, this is the most awesome tasting recipe yet!",
