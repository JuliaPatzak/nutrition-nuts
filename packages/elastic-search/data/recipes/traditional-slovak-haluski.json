    "summary": "This has been in my family for generations coming from Czechoslovakia. Traditionally, it is mixed with goat cheese from Czechoslovakia but since it's not available here in the States, we use brick cheese or feta. We eat this as a main meal but can be served as a side. Serve as is or add kielbasa on the side or slice up kielbasa and mix it in with haluski! Serve with warm crusty bread.",
