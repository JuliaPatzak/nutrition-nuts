    "summary": "I have been making this salad for years and recently traveled from NJ to Oklahoma to make a batch for one of my friends.  I have also Overnighted this salad to a friend in Dallas who simply loves it.  Of course, I pack it in dry ice.  It's fast, simple and great for a cocktail party on party rye, on toast or a bagel for breakfast, on rye with lettuce, thinly sliced onions and dill (or sweet)pickles and mayo for lunch or with pea soup and sandwich for dinner.  It's down right Yummy!!!  And make no changes to the ingredients because the salad will not taste the same.",
