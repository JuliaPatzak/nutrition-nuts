    "summary": "This recipe was created to encourage my picky kids to eat the squash that we had in abundance. These turned out so good they like them better than the 'normal' cinnamon rolls. You can use any type of squash including butternut, acorn, hubbard, or even pumpkin. This recipe is a modified version of Winter Squash Rolls and Clone of a Cinnabon\u00ae.",
