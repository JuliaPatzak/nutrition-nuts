    "summary": "This garlic mayonnaise is excellent with fish.  Serve with grilled salmon, deep fried cod, or baked bass; it is good with these recipes and so many more.  Vary the flavor by using olive oils from Greece, France, or Italy, but definitely choose an extra virgin olive oil.  Do not store for more than a few hours.",
