    "summary": "I love pate so I decided to make some at home. Living in a small town, goose or duck liver is not available. I worked on making a recipe with readily available ingredients, but does not taste like it. Serve with sliced French baguettes, capers, whipped cream cheese, thinly sliced green onions, and black whitefish caviar.",
