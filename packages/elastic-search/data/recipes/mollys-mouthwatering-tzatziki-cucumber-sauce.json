    "summary": "I whipped this up the other night after a fierce craving for a gyro struck me and I was finding a lot of recipes that weren't quite what I was looking for. I wanted a creamier version of tzatziki. I put it on a tortilla with shredded chicken, cheddar, green leaf lettuce and lots of tomatoes and feta. It was sooo good I was eating it by the spoonful! You can play around with adding a little more mayo or sour cream, as my measurements may not have been exact.",
