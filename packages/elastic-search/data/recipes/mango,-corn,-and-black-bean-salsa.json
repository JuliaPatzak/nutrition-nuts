    "summary": "My neighbor introduced me to this cool dish that can stand alone as an easy side dish or tastes great with chicken made up as fajitas. This is a recipe that can be altered to use up other fruits you have on hand. I have used a mix of mangoes and peaches to make this, and it would probably taste great with pineapple or other tart fruits, but if you like mangoes as much as I do, you will want to let that flavor dominate. Optional to chill before serving.",
