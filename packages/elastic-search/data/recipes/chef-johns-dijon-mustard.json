    "summary": "As with all condiments, you can and should adjust this to your taste. This style of Dijon doesn't contain any sweetener, but a little sugar or honey are common additions these days. You can also adjust the acidity, and I did add a little more than called for, since I tend to like things on the sharper side.",
