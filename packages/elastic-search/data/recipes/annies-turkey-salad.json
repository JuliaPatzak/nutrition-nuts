    "summary": "This recipe can be made with leftover turkey, or a turkey breast. It is my great-grandmother's recipe. The cook time will not include the baking of the turkey, just making the salad. Keeping the salad somewhat chunky is part of what makes it good. No food processors, please. I serve this on a bed of red leaf lettuce and garnish with red and green seedless grapes and pecan halves. Cubed jellied cranberry sauce is very good with it, so I place that on the plate around the salad. Serve with assorted crackers or breads.",
