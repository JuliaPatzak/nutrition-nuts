    "summary": "These are an old soul food heirloom favorite in the garden and what I remember eating frequently as a child. I grew the pole variety this summer and they are super prolific/productive. They taste like nothing you buy in a store - super meaty, tender, long-lasting flavor. And now they are a favorite in my own family. The beans will cook in this semi-salty broth, and won't be as salty as is the broth.",
