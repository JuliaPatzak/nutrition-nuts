    "summary": "This is an easy dish and can be made with different variations. It's also good with chicken breasts, or other seafood such as crawfish tails, scallions or crab meat.  Also great with angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine noodles. Sliced white mushrooms can be used if preferred.  Hope you enjoy as much as my family does!",
