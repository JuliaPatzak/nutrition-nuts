    "summary": "Being a big fan of restaurant-style mango-habanero wings, I set out to create something similar. I found multiple recipes online, but none seemed up to my standards. After about a year of making a few and combining different ideas, I came up with this one. Every time I've made this, it's been a huge hit and people are always asking me for the recipe, so here it is. The cornstarch absorbs extra moisture and forms a very thin crispy crust on the wings. It's not a heavy breading, it just adds a bit of crunch.",
