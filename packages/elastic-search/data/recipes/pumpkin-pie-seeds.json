    "summary": "The pumpkins are carved, the pies are baked, but how should you toast those pumpkin seeds? My favorite variation by far are these sweet pumpkin pie-spiced seeds. I've tried the stovetop method for coating the seeds, but they were too sticky and hard for my tastes, and easy to burn too. Try this baking method instead and they'll turn out perfectly toasted and crunchy.",
