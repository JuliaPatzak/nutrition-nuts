    "summary": "My grandmother's chocolate cream pie was a staple of my childhood. Homemade custard filling with a dense texture. Very rich, not too sweet, and oh-so-satisfying. For convenience, I make this with a store-bought graham cracker crust and top with whipped cream, but she used to make hers with a prebaked pastry crust topped with meringue. Either way, it's delicious. Hope you enjoy!",
