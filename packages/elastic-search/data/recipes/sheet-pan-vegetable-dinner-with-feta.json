    "summary": "This sheet pan dinner recipe is super versatile - you can use most vegetables for it, depending on your preference. I chop them very coarsely to save time and the cook time can vary. We eat this as dinner with bread and salad but you can also serve it as a side. Leftovers also taste great cold.",
