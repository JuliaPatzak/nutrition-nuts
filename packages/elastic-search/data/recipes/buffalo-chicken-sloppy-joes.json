    "summary": "Guaranteed to be an instant comfort food favorite. Inspired by a Rachel Ray recipe, I have modified it by adding a creamy and cheesy kick to it.  You'll be dreaming about this dish. Feel free to play with the recipe. I put in the cream cheese and Cheddar to make it creamier.  I am a huge fan of Buffalo Chicken Dip and wanted this dish to be similar.",
