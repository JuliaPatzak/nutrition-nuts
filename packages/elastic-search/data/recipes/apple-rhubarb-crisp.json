    "summary": "Well, I love apple crisps and rhubarb crisp - but didn't like the strawberry. I took a few recipes I found and mixed and matched and got something that everyone loved. Hope you do as well. Apples-to-rhubarb mixture can be tweaked depending on how much you like rhubarb or how tall you want the crisp to be.",
