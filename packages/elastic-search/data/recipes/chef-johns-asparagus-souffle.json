    "summary": "Contrary to popular belief, souffles are not very difficult, as long as you respect the laws of physics. I hope you give this recipe a try, and also experiment with other vegetables. Broccoli, artichokes, leeks, spinach, or any other edible plant you can puree should work with the same basic procedure.",
