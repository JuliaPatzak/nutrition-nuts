    "summary": "I created this recipe to use up a bumper crop of zucchini and to get my kids to eat more fruits and veggies without them knowing it.  It is a dense cake reminiscent of carrot cake.  I frequently add in an extra cup of stir-ins.  Raisins, flake coconut, and walnuts or pecans are favorites.",
