    "summary": "I love popcorn cooked in oil but do not love the mess it makes on my stove, so I decided to give it a try in the Instant Pot\u00ae. Not only does the coconut oil give it that movie theater flavor, there was ZERO grease splatter. I listed salt as a generic seasoning but feel free to experiment with flavors such as powdered cheese, ranch powder, Frank's\u00ae powdered Red Hot\u00ae seasoning, etc.",
