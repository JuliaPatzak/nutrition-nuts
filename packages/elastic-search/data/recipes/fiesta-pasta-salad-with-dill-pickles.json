    "summary": "This dill pickle pasta salad salad has so many different colors that it looks as though there is confetti in it. There is a thousand variations to this salad! My mother adds ham and asparagus to it. I usually use tri-colored pasta in this salad to add even more color. Also I serve green onions on the side. All my friends and family love this so much. I don't think I would be invited on our annual family camping trip if I didn't bring this salad.",
