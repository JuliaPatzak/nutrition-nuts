    "summary": "Most flour tortillas use lard or vegetable shortening as one of the ingredients. This recipe uses canola oil with the same great tortilla taste. A great alternative for those of you who are allergic to soy products. Add a bowl of green chili and then get ready to sop it up with a tasty tortilla. Store tortillas in the refrigerator in a gallon-size plastic bag or place in the freezer.",
