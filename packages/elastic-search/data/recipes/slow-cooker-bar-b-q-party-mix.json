    "summary": "When you're planning a party, and your oven is going to be full, try this party mix in the slow cooker. Tastes as good but doesn't take up oven space! You may make a larger batch, but cooking time will need to be increased. If you like your bar-b-que party mix more bar-b-q-y, try increasing the liquid by 1/2 or double. Keep in mind that doing this may increase cooking time. Serve immediately or store in air tight containers.",
