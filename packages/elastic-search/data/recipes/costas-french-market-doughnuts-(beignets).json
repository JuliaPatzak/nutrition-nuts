    "summary": "As kids, we always put in a heart-filled request for these on Christmas Eve. It was quite a family affair - my mom would make up the dough, my dad would roll them out and cut them and then after frying them up, us kids would take turns shaking them in a paper bag with powdered sugar! I finally got to go to New Orleans and I was excited to get to try 'the real thing' at the famous Cafe Du Monde...I was SO HAPPY because my husband and I both said our recipe was a near carbon copy of CAFE DU MONDE! We've made this recipe for over 40 years and I promise it won't disappoint!",

        "Wait for the mixture to cool down until it is lukewarm",
        "Then, add the yeast and water mixture and beaten eggs",
        "Slowly mix in the flour until the dough forms a ball",
        "Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour",
        "Working with a small portion (a little larger than a baseball) at a time, roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick",
        "Cut the rolled out dough into strips 2 to 3-inches wide, then cut again in the opposite direction and at an angle, making diamond shapes",
        "Heat your oil for frying in a deep and wide, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat to 360 degree F (180 degrees C)",
