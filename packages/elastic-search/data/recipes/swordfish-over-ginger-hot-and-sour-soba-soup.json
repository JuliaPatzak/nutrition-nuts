    "summary": "The aroma is out of this world. This Asian-inspired recipe yields very generous helpings, and is chock-full of veggies and lean protein. Lemongrass and lime give it a nice sour punch. Can easily be tweaked to make it gluten free. Garnish with any leftover cilantro and green onion, if desired.",
