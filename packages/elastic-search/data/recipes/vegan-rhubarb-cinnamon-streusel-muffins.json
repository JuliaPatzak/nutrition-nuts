    "summary": "A delicious way to use fresh rhubarb! These muffins are moist with a sweet cinnamon buttery topping that works so well with the tartness of the rhubarb. I adapted this recipe from the original to make it vegan for my husband. I can't tell the difference between the two, they're both so tasty!",
