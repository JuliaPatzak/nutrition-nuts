    "summary": "This is one of those great, fridge-cleaning recipes...use what you have! My version calls for peppers, onions, tomatoes, hummus, and soy mayo on bread, but it is very versatile and can be easily personalized to your taste. You can easily vary the veggies, the kind of bread, or add spices and still be successful!",
