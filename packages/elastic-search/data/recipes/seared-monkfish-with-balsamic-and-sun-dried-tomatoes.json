    "summary": "I was recently introduced to monkfish (sold as \"monkfish tail\" in fish markets) and it has become a new favorite of mine. It's often called \"poor man's lobster\" because its firm flesh and delicate, slightly sweet flavor are similar to lobster. Served with a balsamic, garlic, and sun-dried tomato topping, this recipe comes together in a snap.",
