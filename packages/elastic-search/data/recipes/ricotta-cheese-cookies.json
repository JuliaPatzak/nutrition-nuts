    "summary": "These soft Italian-style cookies are a hit with everyone. The ricotta  keeps them moist, and the recipe yields a large batch, which is great  since the baked cookies freeze so well. Do not freeze the unbaked  dough.  You can decorate them with chopped candied cherries, colored sugar or candy sprinkles.",
