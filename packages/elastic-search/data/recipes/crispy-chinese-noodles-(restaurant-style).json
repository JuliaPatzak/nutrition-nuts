    "summary": "These light and airy strips add a great garnish to soups or when cut wider, can be a great alternative to regular chips at a Chinese-themed dinner. I love to use them in my chicken corn egg-drop soup! You can vary the amount by cutting only the amount of strips needed for the number of guests. Serve with duck sauce and Chinese mustard sauce for dipping.",

        "2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed",

        "Heat a wok over medium heat until very hot and pour vegetable oil into hot wok",
        "Let oil heat until the surface shimmers",
        "To test heat, lower the tip of a wooden chop stick into the oil; if it bubbles vigorously, oil is heated enough",
        "Cut egg roll wrappers into 1-inch strips and gently lay strips into the hot oil, 2 or 3 at a time",
        "When strips start to brown on one side, gently flip over and brown the other side until the strips are crisp and golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute",
        "Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, working in batches",
        "Remove crisp noodles with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels"
