    "summary": "Just threw it together one evening and it was a smokey delight. Has great flavor and is even better the next day. Has a split pea-like soup texture, and the andouille gives it a nice little kick. You can use kielbasa instead if andouille is too spicy. Or, for a little less heat, use chorizo.",
