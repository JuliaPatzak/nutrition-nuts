    "summary": "Curry has always been a passion of mine, especially Japanese Curry. After years of searching I have discovered the perfect Japanese Curry. Many of these spices can be found at your local Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern markets, or substituted with S&B\u00ae Oriental Curry Powder. Well worth the effort - your family will love this! Serve over steamed rice or noodles.",
