    "summary": "I live in rural West Virginia, and when I crave Vietnamese food there is no restaurant to satiate that craving, so I came up with this close simulation of a noodle bowl entree to cure the craving! The spiciness can be varied to suit your diners, but nearly everyone loves this salad. It makes a lot, so is suitable for cookouts or group suppers. Lots of ingredients, but well worth the bother! Folks will rave, so it is worth it.",
