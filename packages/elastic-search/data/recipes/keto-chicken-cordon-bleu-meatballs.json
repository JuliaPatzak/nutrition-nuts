    "summary": "These ham-stuffed chicken meatballs topped with a creamy Swiss cheese sauce are delicious served over zucchini noodles or mashed cauliflower, or simply on their own! A great way to use up leftover ham. I've used diced ham, however cubed ham work better as the meatballs keep their shape better. Grate your own cheese; it melts much better than the pre-shredded variety.",
