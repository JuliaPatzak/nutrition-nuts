    "summary": "Save yourself time and one less pot to wash by cooking your potatoes and eggs together and in the same pot. I heard about this hack and decided to try it out myself. Not only were the potatoes and eggs cooked perfectly, the shells slipped right off of the eggs, making this a breeze to put together. Feel free to change up the ingredients to suit your go-to potato salad recipe but I highly recommend using this method to cook your potatoes and eggs.",
