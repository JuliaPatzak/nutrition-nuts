    "summary": "I hope this walnut and parsley version serves as a reminder that 'pesto' is not a recipe, but a technique. The buttery walnuts temper the fire of the mashed garlic and pair beautifully with the aromatic, bittersweet parsley. Use on toasted bread, pizza or pasta, or on roasted chicken--it's that versatile!",

        "Place garlic and salt in a mortar; smash and mash with the pestle until it becomes a paste, 5 to 8 minutes",

        "Spread on bread, use on pizza or pasta, or on roasted chicken",
        "The taste is just like garlic butter, so use it as such"
