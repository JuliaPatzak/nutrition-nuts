    "summary": "My dad has been making beef jerky for about as long as I can remember.  He started on an outdoor smoker before graduating to an indoor dehydrator.  He has gotten my husband addicted to it.  You can use any type of meat that you like.  I usually look for large inexpensive roasts with as little fat and marbling as possible.",
