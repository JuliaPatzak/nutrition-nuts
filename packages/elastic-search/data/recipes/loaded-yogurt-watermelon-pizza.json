    "summary": "This recipe is like your favorite bowl of yogurt loaded with all the toppings, just on top of watermelon instead. Watermelon pizza with yogurt makes a striking presentation and is delicious, but also healthier. It makes just as good a guilt-free breakfast as it does a show-stopping dessert. You can use any combination of mixed berries you like.",
