    "summary": "My family loves Tex-Mex dishes and I love quick and convenient but healthy and interesting dishes, and this soup fits the bill in every way.  No one can believe that this hasn't simmered for a long time, as the flavors blend beautifully.  If I don't have guacamole on hand, I blend green chilies with the sour cream -- it's very adaptable.  Serve with tortilla chips!",
