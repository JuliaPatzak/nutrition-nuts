    "summary": "This is one of my \"back pocket\" recipes for a quick and tasty party dip. I've had people ask me if it is chicken salad, because the pineapple adds a texture that is similar to shredded chicken, and the savory ingredients mask the pineapple flavor. It's perfect for a little bite before a meal or a satisfying afternoon snack on your favorite crackers. If you like, you can sneak in some vegetables, and serve it on celery sticks, or those little tri-color mini bell peppers, cut in half.",
