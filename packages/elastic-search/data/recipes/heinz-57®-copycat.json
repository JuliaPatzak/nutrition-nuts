    "summary": "Someone left the bottle empty in the fridge (well, just a few drops is the same as empty). I had just enough to copy it, then when I brought a sample to my unsuspecting taste-tester, he liked mine better than the original! I washed my Heinz 57\u00ae bottle, multiplied this recipe to fill 'er up, and haven't bought another name brand since. Hope you like it!",
