    "summary": "I merged the best of two family recipes, then fiddled a bit.  Pretty easy.  Very Spicy if you use hot Portuguese sausage.  Both the sausage(chourico or linguica) and jarred peppers (Pimenta Moida) are available online if you don't have a Portuguese market in your town.  I prefer linguica for flavoring soups because is has just a little more fat.  If you are trying to limit the fat, stick with chourico.",
