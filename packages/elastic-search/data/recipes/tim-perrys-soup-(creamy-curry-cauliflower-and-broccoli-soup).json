    "summary": "My boss brought this soup to the office one fine day and I was hooked on it from the first taste.  It is a snap to make and the flavors are mild, yet very distinct.  My kids loved it the first time I made it at home and it instantly became known as 'Tim Perry's Soup.' You might like a stronger curry flavour or a creamier soup, so adjust the seasonings to your taste.  It's ready within the hour, but the longer it simmers the better the flavor. Serve with crusty bread and butter.",
