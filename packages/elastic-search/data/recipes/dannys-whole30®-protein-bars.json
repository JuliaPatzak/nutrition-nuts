    "summary": "At long last I'm revealing the recipe for my famous Whole30\u00ae snack bars. They are delicious as a midday snack or post-gym protein bar. Most protein bar recipes call for added sugar, sugar substitutes, artificial sweeteners, or honey...these use chopped dates to be Whole30\u00ae complaint! The recipe is influenced by ingredients found in Jewish macaroons, with egg whites and shredded coconut.",
