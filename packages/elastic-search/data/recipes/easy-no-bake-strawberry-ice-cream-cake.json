    "summary": "It's hard to find a summer dessert easier and more refreshing than this combination of strawberry ice cream and a purchased 10-inch angel food cake! Layers of cake and ice cream, frosted with a purchased frozen whipped topping, are stored in the freezer until you are ready to garnish and slice. This should keep, covered, in the freezer for a week or two. I've never been able to find out exactly how long it will store, because it's usually gone in a few days!",
