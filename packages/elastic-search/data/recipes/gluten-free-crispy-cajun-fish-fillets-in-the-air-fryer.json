    "summary": "Cajun fish fillets made in the air fryer pack just enough heat and are perfectly crispy using gluten-free panko bread crumbs. I serve these as sandwiches on a gluten-free bun with lettuce, tomatoes, tartar sauce, and Cheddar cheese slices. Alternatively, you can skip the bun and serve in lettuce wraps or with a salad.",
