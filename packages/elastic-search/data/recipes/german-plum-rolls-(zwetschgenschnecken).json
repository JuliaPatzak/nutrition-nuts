    "summary": "In Germany, cakes made with plum are very popular. This variation can be made as either a whole cake or as individual 'tarts.' I call them 'rolls' due to their appearance.  They are very delicious on a Sunday fall afternoon with a hot cup of tea! They're best when still warm and served with whipped cream!",
