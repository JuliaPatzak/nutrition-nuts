    "summary": "I make these for teachers for Valentine's Day, but they are wonderful any day of the week. They are tender and flaky and lemony. You can use dried cranberries (which I do) and leave out the nuts if you'd like. The glaze is wonderful, and I haven't found a person who doesn't just love these scones.",
