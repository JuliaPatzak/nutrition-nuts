    "summary": "Skirt steak is an inexpensive cut of beef taken from the diaphragm muscle.  It ranks with filet mignon as my favorite juicy and tender cut.  It comes in long, narrow strips about 3/4 lb. each.  The grain runs across the narrow side and so for serving the steak should be cut into serving-size pieces with the grain so that it can then be cut into bites against the grain.",
