    "summary": "This is my own take on beignets, a classic French dessert recipe. I take fresh strawberries, coat them with batter, then fry them, beignet-style. These strawberry fritters make my mouth water, they are so good. I love the combination of airy, crisp pastry, with lightly cooked fresh strawberries, and rich chocolate sauce.",
