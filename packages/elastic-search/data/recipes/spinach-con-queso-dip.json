    "summary": "This creamy dip is excellent warm with fresh vegetables or with freshly made flour tortilla chips (I cut tortillas into triangles and bake or fry them with vegetable oil). If you have a taste for something a bit spicier, add some finely minced jalapeno, serrano or habanero chiles. Delicious!",
