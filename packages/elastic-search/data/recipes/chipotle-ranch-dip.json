    "summary": "I came up with a very quick, easy lower-in-fat dip or sauce to make with those leftover chipotle peppers. This dip combines the smoky chipotle with the great seasoning of ranch dressing mix. Makes a great veggie dip, or even a topping on hamburgers or Mexican foods. Chipotle peppers are very spicy; start with one and taste. Removing seeds will tone down the heat. I usually use 2 with seeds. You can also substitute low-fat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.",
