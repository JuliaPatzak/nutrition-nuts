    "summary": "I have had this recipe for over 40 years and it has never failed. The aroma of it baking is wonderful, and it also makes great toast. Also a great addition to have with baked brown beans. This freezes very well; I cut the loaf up before I freeze, that way I take out just the slices I need.",
