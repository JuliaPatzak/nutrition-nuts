    "summary": "This past summer I found myself asking how I was going to preserve the abundance of grape tomatoes I had from my garden. Sun drying was the only thing I could come up with but problem was, there wasn't any sun. Air fryer to the rescue! I have a small air fryer so I wrote this up for 5 ounces (12 grape tomatoes) so that it would be easy to do in small batches. Store in an airtight container in the freezer for re-hydrating or pack in oil and store in the refrigerator for salads, soups, sauces, etc.",
