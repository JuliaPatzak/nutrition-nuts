    "summary": "These fish cakes are great with tartar or cocktail sauce or a simple squeeze of fresh lemon or lime.  For a change of pace add a bit of chili powder, cilantro and jalapeno or a teaspoon of Cajun spice. Nice served with boiled red potatoes and a spinach salad. This recipe has two cooking options: you can fry the cakes or bake them -- it's up to you!",
