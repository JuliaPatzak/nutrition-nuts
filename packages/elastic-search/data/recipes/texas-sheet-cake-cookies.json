    "summary": "This is the cookie version of the fudgy, chocolaty goodness that is a Texas sheet cake. Make sure to frost these cookies while both the cookies, and the frosting, are still warm--because this frosting sets up quickly! Feel free to top these with either chopped walnuts or pecans, if desired. Store in airtight containers.",
