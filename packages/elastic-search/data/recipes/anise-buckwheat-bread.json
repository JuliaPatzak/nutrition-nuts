        "Place the buckwheat groats and 2/3 cup of water in a small saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil",
        "Reduce the heat to low, and simmer the buckwheat until the grains have softened, about 10 minutes",
        "Remove from the heat and set aside",
        "Whisk together the yeast, 1/2 cup of water, and 1/2 cup of bread flour in a bowl, and let stand until the mixture is frothy, about 10 minutes",
        "In a separate large bowl, stir together the 1/2 cup of water with vegetable oil, honey, salt, whole wheat flour, and anise seed to make a thick, smooth batter",
        "Mix in the yeast mixture and the cooled buckwheat groats",
        "Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing in each addition before adding the next",

        "Form the dough into a compact ball, and place into an oiled bowl, turning the dough in the bowl to coat with oil",
