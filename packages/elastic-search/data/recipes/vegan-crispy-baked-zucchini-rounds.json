    "summary": "Because these turn out so well without having to dip them in any milk or eggs, they make a fantastic vegan treat! But even for the die-hard carnivores in my house, this makes an easy and delicious appetizer, quick snack, or side dish.  The breading is nice and light, and they are crispier than traditional breaded zucchini because they are baked rather than fried. They are good just as they are, but my son loves to dip his in ranch dressing!",
