    "summary": "Living in the States, it has been hard for me to find the original ingredients for traditional sofrito from Puerto Rico, so this is the base I came up with and have been using for years in all of my Latin bean, stew, soup or rice recipes. I always keep a small bowl of it in the fridge and freeze the rest. Enjoy!",
