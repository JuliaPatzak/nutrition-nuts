    "summary": "This is a recipe that is often  asked for at the restaurant where I work. They never let us make it, but we get asked by guests a lot. We are a full-service French restaurant. This is a home favorite with my wife and kid. Almost as good as rabbit and pig! It's an etouffee to love: thick, rich, and full of taste. Serve on hot steamed rice with garlic bread and a green salad. Enjoy!",
