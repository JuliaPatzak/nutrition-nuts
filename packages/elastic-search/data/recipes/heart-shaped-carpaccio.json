    "summary": "This would make for a creative, and visually arresting start to a Valentine's Day dinner menu. Most carpaccios are pounded very, very thin, but if you're using a really nice piece of beef tenderloin, why smash it so flat? Since it's naturally tender and buttery, I like it to keep a little bit of its texture, instead of being mashed too thin.",
