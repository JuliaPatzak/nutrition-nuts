    "summary": "As I was craving a seasonal treat to use some leftover canned pumpkin, I created this modification of a widely available chocolate cake recipe. These delights are moist and delicious! You may frost with your favorite buttercream or cream cheese frosting and decorate, or leave plain. These babies are so moist, they don't demand frosting.",
