    "summary": "This heart-healthy, quick, and easy dish is something very easy to throw together for dinner. It's perfect for dinner and lunch the next day and is just as tasty hot or cold. Kate originally came up with this recipe after coming back from the gym with no fresh ingredients on hand. Just by using what was in the pantry and freezer this amazing dish came together. Although it is vegetarian friendly, many meat eaters will be satisfied with this high-protein meal.",
