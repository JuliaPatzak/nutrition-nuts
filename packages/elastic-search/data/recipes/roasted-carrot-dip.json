    "summary": "Surprise your guests with this unique and flavorful dip. Sweet, caramelized flavors, paired with a hint of heat from the chile oil. Add as much or as little oil as you'd like, or omit completely if you prefer. Use different fresh or dried peppers to infuse the oil. This reheats exceptionally well; in fact, I find it more flavorful the next day. Serve with wheat crackers or pita chips. Instead of parsley, you can top with crushed pistachios or pumpkin seeds.",
