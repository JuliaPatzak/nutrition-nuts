    "summary": "A gluten-free pie crust using common ingredients. I've adjusted the method over time and have found this final recipe to work every time. It is perfect for both sweet and savory dishes. The trick is leaving large chunks of butter, whole, so they create a flaky crust. The baked crust holds its shape quite well and delivers a nice slice of filled pie beautifully without falling apart.",
