    "summary": "These potatoes are perfect for Thanksgiving and Christmas!  They are my husband's family tradition in Pennsylvania. This is the actual recipe from my husband's great-grandmother.  I cut it down by a third for my family of 4.  But I have given you the full recipe so you can cut it however you would like. There is a family 'secret ingredient' that I have never been told and so it's not in this recipe :(  I believe it will still be yummy without the 'secret,' but if you happen to know what that is, then add it in ;)",
