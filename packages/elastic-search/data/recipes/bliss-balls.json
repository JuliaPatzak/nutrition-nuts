    "summary": "These are raw, gluten-free, wheat-free, low glycemic snacks that are loaded with potent proteins, enzymes and nutrients. They contain copious amounts of raw superfoods, protein-rich spirulina, and raw Ecuadorian cacao. Think of them as a round granola bar: lots of packed energy, and easy to eat on the go. This is my go-to snack. For longer-term storage, keep in the freezer.",
