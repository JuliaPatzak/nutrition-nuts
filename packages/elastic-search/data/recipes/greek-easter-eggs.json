    "summary": "I found how to make this dye online, but I changed the technique because I did not get good results that way. The first Easter that I celebrated with my husband's family was wonderful. After Easter dinner, a tray of red-dyed hard-boiled eggs was placed on the table. (The deep red eggs remind us of the blood of Christ.) Everyone chose one egg and then paired up two-by-two. Taking the eggs and matching fat or pointed end to end, as they said 'Christos Anesti' they tapped the ends of the eggs together and whoever's egg remained unbroken 'won'. This continued (both ends of the egg can be used as long as matching ends tap each other) until the last person had at least one end of their egg in tact. This was a fun and joy-filled way to help celebrate.",
