    "summary": "Simple, but very tasty! One of my favorite Turkish foods. Literally, kadin buddu means 'ladies' thighs.' Coated in egg and then fried, Turkish koftas come in all shapes, sizes, and degrees of spiciness. You can do a lot with them. Serve with breads, rice, sauces, gravies, salads, and onion rings, or serve them as-is for an appetizer or snack.",
