    "summary": "I took my 3-year-old fishing for the first time and we caught two trout. I never made trout before. I literally made this recipe up as I went, with what I found in the kitchen. I checked other recipes to get cooking times. I went a little longer on the cooking time because of the bacon. I'm only posting this because the entire family loved it.",
