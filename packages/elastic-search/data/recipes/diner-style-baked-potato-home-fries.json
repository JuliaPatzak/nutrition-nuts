    "summary": "When I was working my way through college at a local diner, I learned that they used leftover baked potatoes from the dinner menu that they baked the day before.  They always made extra baked potatoes so that they could use them for home fries the next morning.  I discovered that this was the 'secret' to having flaky, crispy home fries.  Very easy to make.",
