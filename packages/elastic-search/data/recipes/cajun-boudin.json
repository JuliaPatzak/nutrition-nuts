        "Combine the pork shoulder, liver, and 4 cups of water in a large saucepan",

        "Bring the rice and 4 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes",
        "Set aside",
        "Once the pork is tender, remove from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and allow to cool a bit",
        "While the pork is cooling, stir the green onion, chopped onion, celery, bell pepper, parsley, cilantro, and garlic into the simmering pork broth",
