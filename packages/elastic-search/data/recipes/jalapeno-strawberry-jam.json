    "summary": "This is a favorite in our family at Christmas.  This jam is not spicy, but can be made to be spicy by adding more peppers or a few habanero peppers.  The flavor of the sweet strawberries combined with the flavor of the peppers gives this jam a wonderful flavor dimension. The strawberries may be frozen (thawed and crushed) and the peppers may be canned (drained and chopped).",
