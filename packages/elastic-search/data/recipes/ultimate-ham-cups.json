    "summary": "I created this recipe to use leftovers from Thanksgiving for a day-after brunch. It combines the best of the holiday flavors - smoked ham, cranberries, almonds, and smoked mozzarella cheese - into puff pastry shells, to make a really elegant presentation for a buffet, or it could be put into mini muffin pans for an appetizer. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley or paprika if desired.",
