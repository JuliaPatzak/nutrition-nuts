    "summary": "This is my mother's recipe, a bread she always made at Thanksgiving and Christmas to be used for tea sandwiches with a cream cheese filling. But it may also be eaten on its own like a cake. Because it is so delicious yet simple to put together, it makes a great food gift or potluck contribution. Substitute raisins for dates, if you wish.",
