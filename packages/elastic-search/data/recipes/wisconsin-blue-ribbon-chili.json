    "summary": "This chili earned its blue ribbon at a chili cook-off three years in a row! It is a mild, sweet chili, but it could always be spiced up with a little hot sauce. In Wisconsin, chili has macaroni noodles in it, which my husband thinks is the best part of this recipe. Enjoy! Add canned kidney beans with the macaroni, if desired.",
