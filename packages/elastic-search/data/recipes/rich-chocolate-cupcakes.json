    "summary": "My mom made wedding cakes throughout my whole childhood. People would always tell her that her cakes were not only beautiful, but the best tasting cakes they have ever tasted. Her secret was to combine a good scratch recipe with a boxed cake mix. It would make a light, moist cake which held up well when stacked. I have never strayed from her recipes and use them every time!",
