    "summary": "Growing up, I remember my dad making these for me every time we had leftover rice in the fridge. I generally make these for breakfast but occasionally enjoy them for dinner when my husband is out of town and I want to make something quick and easy. This recipe is a great base. Have fun changing it up and making it your own! Great topped with salsa!",
