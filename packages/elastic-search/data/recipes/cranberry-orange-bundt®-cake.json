    "summary": "I bought the cutest little 4.5-cup capacity Bundt\u00ae pan to bake smaller cakes for just me and my husband. This recipe fit perfectly in it, and was just the right amount for us. Cranberries and orange peel are finely chopped and beat into the batter, so you get those flavors throughout the cake. Decorating with the sugared cranberries is optional, but makes for a beautiful presentation.",
