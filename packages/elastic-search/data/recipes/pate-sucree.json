    "summary": "It is a typically French pie crust also known as Pate Sablee.  I hope it helps you and anyone else looking for pie dough. Use real butter and fresh eggs for best results. Note: The dough is generally cooked at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 minutes. The dough will work well with tarts, large and small, and pies. Don't forget to prick the dough with a fork just as you would with other doughs.",
