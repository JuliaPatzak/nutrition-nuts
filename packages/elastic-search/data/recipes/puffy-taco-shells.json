    "summary": "I just don't get to San Antonio, home of the puffy taco, as much as I'd like to. So I tried to recreate it at home and it worked out great! Be sure you have the meat and fixings ready ahead of time so all you have to do is fry and fill! These work best when served as warm as possible.",
