    "summary": "I had this amazing dish at a lovely Pacific Northwest steakhouse and I knew I had to figure out how to make this special treat. These potatoes were so delicious, I could have skipped the steak entirely. This is my take on this rich and decadent side dish. This has become one of our traditions on Valentine's Day with a fabulous tenderloin steak. YUMMY! This would work well with your own mashed potato recipe instead of the basic mashed potato recipe listed here. You could certainly do this recipe with lobster tails instead of the whole lobster. You could even use precooked lobster ignoring the lobster cooking instructions. It looks like it is time consuming, but it is so easy and worth the effort for a special meal.",
