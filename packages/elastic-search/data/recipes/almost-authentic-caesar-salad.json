    "summary": "I always hated gloppy Caesar dressings, so I came up with my own, which is very similar to the original one created in Tijuana in the 1920s. This quick and easy salad is a huge hit whenever I serve it, and it easy to prepare ahead of time. Just wait until the last minute to combine the lettuce, croutons, dressing, and cheese. The key is to use real grated Parmesan cheese, not the stuff in the can.",
