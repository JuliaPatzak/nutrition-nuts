    "summary": "This is one that was recited to me out of memory alone, and described as a hand of garlic, etc., though the ingredient quantities should be accurate. I encourage buying the cheapest versions of these ingredients you can find; it will feed an army for about $15 without ruining the taste. You should add more seasonings based on preference. A great vegetarian sauce, and with meatballs...it makes great meatball sandwiches.",
