    "summary": "I started this bread because I needed to bake something to bring as a gift to someone's house and quickly found that my ingredients were limited to a few summertime fruits and veggies and not much else. As such, I improvised and changed a few things around from a zucchini bread recipe and created this healthy, hearty, summertime bread. It has a slightly different flavor than zucchini bread but the same moist consistency and sweet, summery taste and smell. Note: it is not very sweet and does taste 'healthy', so it's probably not a big hit for kids unless chocolate chips are added.",
