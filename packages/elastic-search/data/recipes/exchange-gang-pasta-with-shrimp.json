    "summary": "I have made several friends on the Recipe Exchange here.  One of them posted a request asking other members to each suggest one ingredient and challenged me to make a dish out of only those ingredients, plus salt and pepper.  After 15 minutes, she gave me the list.  People had so much fun participating and I had a blast creating the dish.  It turned out so good that my kids licked their plates!  Everyone who participated deserves credit for creating the dish, so I have given their display names next to their ingredient.  The recipe you see here is the result of that incredibly fun challenge.",
