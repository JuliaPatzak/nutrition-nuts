    "summary": "I made this while camping. It was a break at camp when nobody was there, so I picked up some worms at the trading post and went off to fish down at the lake. I caught 12 bass with the help of my dad, who came down there after he played guitar at the trading post. It was 7:00 when I brought them all back to camp and thought to eat them since everyone already ate dinner while I was gone. So I fried them up in some crushed chips leftover from lunch. Yum, yum, yum.",
