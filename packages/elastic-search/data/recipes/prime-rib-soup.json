    "summary": "This rich and satisfying soup is the best I've ever created. Hubby is always excited when I make a prime rib because he knows this soup will follow within a day or two. The ribs are sliced from the prime rib before serving and saved just for this recipe. I always buy a prime rib with the bones in because it makes the roast better tasting and the ribs are a bonus not to be missed!",
