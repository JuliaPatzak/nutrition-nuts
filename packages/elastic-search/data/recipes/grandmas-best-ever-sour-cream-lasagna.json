    "summary": "This is my grandma's famous recipe, except that I use sour cream instead of the traditional cheeses (a trick I picked up from my mother-in-law).  She always made it for birthday dinners and special occasions.  This makes a large amount.  I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. It's very cheesy - sometimes I add a little extra tomato sauce.  Enjoy!",
