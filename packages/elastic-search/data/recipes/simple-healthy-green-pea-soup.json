    "summary": "Recovering from surgery and a bad case of strep throat, I threw this together to aid my body through recovery.  Eating this soup is a great way to pack in the nutrients. Light, clean, filling, and full of flavor. My kids love it. I just add a little milk to cool it down so they can eat it right away.",
