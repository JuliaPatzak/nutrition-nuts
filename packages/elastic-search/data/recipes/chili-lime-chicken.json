    "summary": "This recipe combines many of the spices that I grew up with and that have become a distinctive part of much of my cooking including dishes such as chili Colorado, posole, and Frontera\u2122 style carne asada. I would describe this dish as more Tex-Mex or New Mexican than Mexican. Serve on a bed of rice or slice thinly for use in tacos or to top a green salad.",
