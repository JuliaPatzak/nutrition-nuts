    "summary": "Here in Lyon, France there are little bouchons everywhere that serve pork as a specialty. One of the entry-meal items is a salad called Salade Lyonnaise. This salad is delicious in flavor and packed with protein. I changed some of the ingredients to reflect a better flavor. Very simple, very French. This makes enough salad for 4 people.",
