        "Place yeast and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer; whisk to mix",
        "Add flour and salt",
        "Knead with dough hook until mixture forms a soft, sticky dough ball and easily pulls away from the sides and the hook, about 5 minutes",
        "(If still too sticky, add a bit more flour and knead a few more seconds",
        ") Transfer dough to a work surface and form into a smooth ball",
        "Place dough back in the mixing bowl",
        "Drizzle the dough and sides of bowl a few drops of vegetable oil",
        "Spread a film of oil over the surface of the dough",

        "With a very sharp knife, score each roll about 1/4 inch deep along one side somewhere between the side and the top",

        "Bake in preheated oven about 20 minutes",
        "Spritz loaves again and rotate pans for a more even bake",
