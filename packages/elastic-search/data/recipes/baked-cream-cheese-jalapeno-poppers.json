    "summary": "After a number of unsatisfactory attempts at making deep-fried poppers, I modified a recipe by Emeril that is much easier than frying and everyone in our family agrees that these are at least as good as -- if not better than -- any fried poppers they have had! We love hot peppers and always make a lot of these from the ones we grow in our garden every year.",
