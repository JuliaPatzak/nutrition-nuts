    "summary": "I ate this with rice or coconut roti almost every evening in Sri Lanka-- I could not get enough of it!  Using fresh ingredients is of the utmost importance.  Some of the ingredients may be difficult to find, but they really are essential. This goes very well with rice as a vegetarian entree or alone as a side dish.",
