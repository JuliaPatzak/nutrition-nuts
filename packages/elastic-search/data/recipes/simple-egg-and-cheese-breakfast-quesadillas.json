    "summary": "This is a recipe that I made up after being disappointed by the Dunkin' Donuts\u00ae breakfast quesadilla. These quesadillas are satisfying and filling, and a good way to start your day. I make these the night before for my husband. He re-warms them in the microwave or the toaster oven and they are as good as freshly made. They can also be made in advance and frozen for future breakfasts.",
