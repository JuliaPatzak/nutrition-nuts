    "summary": "My husband just hasn't found a good cracker since going gluten-free, and he loved his butter crackers! I adapted this recipe from several different ones I was able to find on the web. Now I have to control what my non-GF kids eat so that dad will have some for the next day! These are not light and flaky, but the taste is definitely there! Welcome back peanut butter and crackers, cheese and crackers, plain crackers for nomming on! Also, I would expect you could add seasonings like garlic or sprinkle with Parmesan instead of salt, and kick it up a notch.",
