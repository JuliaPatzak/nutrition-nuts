    "summary": "These are awesome! Straight out of Brooklyn is the Coney knish with a flaky crust and filled with potato, fried onion, and yes, hot dogs. These tasty treats are very popular in Brooklyn kosher deli and take out places. Sometimes I'll cut each one into 3 or 4 pieces before baking and serve them as a hot appetizer. Serve with a side of spicy brown mustard for dipping.",
