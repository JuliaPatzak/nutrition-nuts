    "summary": "My grandma called this soup Hobo Soup. She said it was something they made way back when, out of whatever they had available in their garden and shelves. It is a large dish (they were a family of 10), so have a big pot or slow cooker! I have halved it and honed it a little since most of us use a grocery now and don't have 8 kids.",
